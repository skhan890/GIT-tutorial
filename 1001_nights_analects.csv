THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Niuna corrotta mente intese mai sanamente parole.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Erubuit, posuitque meum Lucretia librum Sed coram Bruto. Brute!"

THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,le propre des hommes.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The pleasure we derive from perusing the Thousand and One
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Stories makes us regret that we possess only a comparatively
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,small part of these truly enchanting fictions.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And afterwards. Verily the works and words of those gone before
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us have become instances and examples to men of our modern day,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that folk may view what admonishing chances befel other folk and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,may therefrom take warning; and that they may peruse the annals
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of antique peoples and all that hath betided them, and be thereby"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ruled and restrained:--Praise, therefore, be to Him who hath made"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the histories of the Past an admonition unto the Present! Now of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,such instances are the tales called A Thousand Nights and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Night, together with their far famed legends and wonders."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Therein it is related (but Allah is All knowing of His hidden
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,things and All ruling and All honoured and All giving and All
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gracious and All merciful [FN#1]) that, in tide of yore and in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"time long gone before, there was a King of the Kings of the Banu"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sásán in the Islands of India and China, a Lord of armies and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"guards and servants and dependents.[FN#2] He left only two sons,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one in the prime of manhood and the other yet a youth, while both"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"were Knights and Braves, albeit the elder was a doughtier"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,horseman than the younger. So he succeeded to the empire; when he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ruled the land and forded it over his lieges with justice so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,exemplary that he was beloved by all the peoples of his capital
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and of his kingdom. His name was King Shahryár[FN#3], and he made"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his younger brother, Shah Zamán hight, King of Samarcand in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Barbarian land. These two ceased not to abide in their several
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,realms and the law was ever carried out in their dominions; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"each ruled his own kingdom, with equity and fair dealing to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"subjects, in extreme solace and enjoyment; and this condition"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,continually endured for a score of years. But at the end of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,twentieth twelvemonth the elder King yearned for a sight of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,younger brother and felt that he must look upon him once more. So
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he took counsel with his Wazír[FN#4] about visiting him, but the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Minister, finding the project unadvisable, recommended that a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,letter be written and a present be sent under his charge to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,younger brother with an invitation to visit the elder. Having
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,accepted this advice the King forthwith bade prepare handsome
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gifts, such as horses with saddles of gem encrusted gold;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Mamelukes, or white slaves; beautiful handmaids, high breasted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"virgins, and splendid stuffs and costly. He then wrote a letter"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to Shah Zaman expressing his warm love and great wish to see
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, ending with these words, We therefore hope of the favour"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and affection of the beloved brother that he will condescend to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bestir himself and turn his face us wards. Furthermore we have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sent our Wazir to make all ordinance for the march, and our one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and only desire is to see thee ere we die; but if thou delay or
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disappoint us we shall not survive the blow. Wherewith peace be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon thee! Then King Shahryar, having sealed the missive and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"given it to the Wazir with the offerings aforementioned,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,commanded him to shorten his skirts and strain his strength and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,make all expedition in going and returning. Harkening and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"obedience! quoth the Minister, who fell to making ready without"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stay and packed up his loads and prepared all his requisites
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"without delay. This occupied him three days, and on the dawn of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the fourth he took leave of his King and marched right away, over"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"desert and hill' way, stony waste and pleasant lea without"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,halting by night or by day. But whenever he entered a realm whose
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ruler was subject to his Suzerain, where he was greeted with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,magnificent gifts of gold and silver and all manner of presents
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fair and rare, he would tarry there three days,[FN#5] the term"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the guest rite; and, when he left on the fourth, he would be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,honourably escorted for a whole day's march. As soon as the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wazir drew near Shah Zaman's court in Samarcand he despatched to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"report his arrival one of his high officials, who presented"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself before the King; and, kissing ground between his hands,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,delivered his message. Hereupon the King commanded sundry of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Grandees and Lords of his realm to fare forth and meet his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brother's Wazir at the distance of a full day's journey; which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they did, greeting him respectfully and wishing him all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,prosperity and forming an escort and a procession. When he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered the city he proceeded straightway to the palace, where"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he presented himself in the royal presence; and, after kissing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ground and praying for the King's health and happiness and for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"victory over all his enemies, he informed him that his brother"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was yearning to see him, and prayed for the pleasure of a visit."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,He then delivered the letter which Shah Zaman took from his hand
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and read: it contained sundry hints and allusions which required
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thought; but, when the King had fully comprehended its import, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, I hear and I obey the commands of the beloved brother!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"adding to the Wazir, But we will not march till after the third"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,day's hospitality. He appointed for the Minister fitting
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quarters of the palace; and, pitching tents for the troops,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rationed them with whatever they might require of meat and drink
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and other necessaries. On the fourth day he made ready for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wayfare and got together sumptuous presents befitting his elder
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother's majesty, and stablished his chief Wazir viceroy of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,land during his absence. Then he caused his tents and camels and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mules to be brought forth and encamped, with their bales and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loads, attend ants and guards, within sight of the city, in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,readiness to set out next morning for his brother's capital. But
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when the night was half spent he bethought him that he had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forgotten in his palace somewhat which he should have brought
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with him, so he re turned privily and entered his apartments,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"where he found the Queen, his wife, asleep on his own carpet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bed, embracing with both arms a black cook of loathsome aspect"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and foul with kitchen grease and grime. When he saw this the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"world waxed black before his sight and he said, If such case"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,happen while I am yet within sight of the city what will be the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,doings of this damned whore during my long absence at my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother's court? So he drew his scymitar and, cutting the two in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"four pieces with a single blow, left them on the carpet and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,returned presently to his camp without letting anyone know of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what had happened. Then he gave orders for immediate departure
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and set out at once and began his travel; but he could not help
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thinking over his wife's treason and he kept ever saying to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself, How could she do this deed by me? How could she work"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her own death?, till excessive grief seized him, his colour"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"changed to yellow, his body waxed weak and he was threatened"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with a dangerous malady, such an one as bringeth men to die. So"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Wazir shortened his stages and tarried long at the watering
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stations and did his best to solace the King. Now when Shah Zaman
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drew near the capital of his brother he despatched vaunt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"couriers and messengers of glad tidings to announce his arrival,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and Shahryar came forth to meet him with his Wazirs and Emirs
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and Lords and Grandees of his realm; and saluted him and joyed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with exceeding joy and caused the city to be decorated in his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"honour. When, however, the brothers met, the elder could not but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,see the change of complexion in the younger and questioned him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of his case whereto he replied, Tis caused by the travails of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wayfare and my case needs care, for I have suffered from the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,change of water and air! but Allah be praised for reuniting me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with a brother so dear and so rare! On this wise he dissembled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and kept his secret, adding, O King of the time and Caliph of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the tide, only toil and moil have tinged my face yellow with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bile and hath made my eyes sink deep in my head. Then the two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,entered the capital in all honour; and the elder brother lodged
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the younger in a palace overhanging the pleasure garden; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after a time, seeing his condition still unchanged, he attributed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it to his separation from his country and kingdom. So he let him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wend his own ways and asked no questions of him till one day when
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he again said, O my brother, I see thou art grown weaker of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"body and yellower of colour. O my brother, replied Shah Zaman"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I have an internal wound:[FN#6] still he would not tell him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what he had witnessed in his wife. Thereupon Shahryar summoned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,doctors and surgeons and bade them treat his brother according
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the rules of art, which they did for a whole month; but their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sherbets and potions naught availed, for he would dwell upon the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deed of his wife, and despondency, instead of diminishing,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prevailed, and leach craft treatment utterly failed. One day his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"elder brother said to him, I am going forth to hunt and course"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and to take my pleasure and pastime; maybe this would lighten thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heart. Shah Zaman, however, refused, saying, O my brother, my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,soul yearneth for naught of this sort and I entreat thy favour to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"suffer me tarry quietly in this place, being wholly taken up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with my malady. So King Shah Zaman passed his night in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"palace and, next morning, when his brother had fared forth, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,removed from his room and sat him down at one of the lattice
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,windows overlooking the pleasure grounds; and there he abode
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thinking with saddest thought over his wife's betrayal and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,burning sighs issued from his tortured breast. And as he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"continued in this case lo! a pastern of the palace, which was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carefully kept private, swung open and out of it came twenty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slave girls surrounding his bother's wife who was wondrous fair,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a model of beauty and comeliness and symmetry and perfect
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loveliness and who paced with the grace of a gazelle which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,panteth for the cooling stream. Thereupon Shah Zaman drew back
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from the window, but he kept the bevy in sight espying them from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a place whence he could not be espied. They walked under the very
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lattice and advanced a little way into the garden till they came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to a jetting fountain amiddlemost a great basin of water; then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they stripped off their clothes and behold, ten of them were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"women, concubines of the King, and the other ten were white"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slaves. Then they all paired off, each with each: but the Queen,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who was left alone, presently cried out in a loud voice, Here to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, O my lord Saeed! and then sprang with a drop leap from one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the trees a big slobbering blackamoor with rolling eyes which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"showed the whites, a truly hideous sight.[FN#7] He walked boldly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up to her and threw his arms round her neck while she embraced
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him as warmly; then he bussed her and winding his legs round
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hers, as a button loop clasps a button, he threw her and enjoyed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her. On like wise did the other slaves with the girls till all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had satisfied their passions, and they ceased not from kissing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and clipping, coupling and carousing till day began to wane; when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Mamelukes rose from the damsels' bosoms and the blackamoor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slave dismounted from the Queen's breast; the men resumed their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"disguises and all, except the negro who swarmed up the tree,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered the palace and closed the postern door as before. Now,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when Shah Zaman saw this conduct of his sister in law he said in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself, By Allah, my calamity is lighter than this! My brother"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is a greater King among the kings than I am, yet this infamy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"goeth on in his very palace, and his wife is in love with that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,filthiest of filthy slaves. But this only showeth that they all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,do it[FN#8] and that there is no woman but who cuckoldeth her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"husband, then the curse of Allah upon one and all and upon the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fools who lean against them for support or who place the reins of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,conduct in their hands. So he put away his melancholy and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"despondency, regret and repine, and allayed his sorrow by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"constantly repeating those words, adding,  'Tis my conviction"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that no man in this world is safe from their malice! When supper
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,time came they brought him the trays and he ate with voracious
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"appetite, for he had long refrained from meat, feeling unable to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,touch any dish however dainty. Then he returned grateful thanks
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to Almighty Allah, praising Him and blessing Him, and he spent a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"most restful night, it having been long since he had savoured the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sweet food of sleep. Next day he broke his fast heartily and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"began to recover health and strength, and presently regained"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,excellent condition. His brother came back from the chase ten
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"days after, when he rode out to meet him and they saluted each"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,other; and when King Shahryar looked at King Shah Zaman he saw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"how the hue of health had returned to him, how his face had waxed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ruddy and how he ate with an appetite after his late scanty diet.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"He wondered much and said, O my brother, I was so anxious that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou wouldst join me in hunting and chasing, and wouldst take thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pleasure and pastime in my dominion! He thanked him and excused
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself; then the two took horse and rode into the city and, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they were seated at their ease in the palace, the food trays were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,set before them and they ate their sufficiency. After the meats
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"were removed and they had washed their hands, King Shahryar"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"turned to his brother and said, My mind is overcome with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wonderment at thy condition. I was desirous to carry thee with me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the chase but I saw thee changed in hue, pale and wan to view,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and in sore trouble of mind too. But now Alham-dolillah--glory be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to God!--I see thy natural colour hath returned to thy face and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that thou art again in the best of case. It was my belief that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy sickness came of severance from thy family and friends, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"absence from capital and country, so I refrained from troubling"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee with further questions. But now I beseech thee to expound to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me the cause of thy complaint and thy change of colour, and to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,explain the reason of thy recovery and the return to the ruddy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hue of health which I am wont to view. So speak out and hide
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,naught! When Shah Zaman heard this he bowed groundwards awhile
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his head, then raised it and said, I will tell thee what caused"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my complaint and my loss of colour; but excuse my acquainting
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee with the cause of its return to me and the reason of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,complete recovery: indeed I pray thee not to press me for a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reply. Said Shahryar, who was much surprised by these words,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Let me hear first what produced thy pallor and thy poor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"condition. Know, then, O my brother, rejoined Shah Zaman,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that when thou sentest thy Wazir with the invitation to place
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"myself between thy hands, I made ready and marched out of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,city; but presently I minded me having left behind me in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,palace a string of jewels intended as a gift to thee. I returned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for it alone and found my wife on my carpet bed and in the arms
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of a hideous black cook. So I slew the twain and came to thee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,yet my thoughts brooded over this business and I lost my bloom
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and became weak. But excuse me if I still refuse to tell thee
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what was the reason of my complexion returning. Shahryar shook
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his head, marvelling with extreme marvel, and with the fire of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wrath flaming up from his heart, he cried, Indeed, the malice of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,woman is mighty! Then he took refuge from them with Allah and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, In very sooth, O my brother, thou hast escaped many an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"evil by putting thy wife to death,[FN#9] and right excusable were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy wrath and grief for such mishap which never yet befel crowned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King like thee. By Allah, had the case been mine, I would not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have been satisfied without slaying a thousand women and that way
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,madness lies! But now praise be to Allah who hath tempered to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee thy tribulation, and needs must thou acquaint me with that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which so suddenly restored to thee complexion and health, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"explain to me what causeth this concealment. O King of the Age,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again I pray thee excuse my so doing! Nay, but thou must. I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fear, O my brother, lest the recital cause thee more anger and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sorrow than afflicted me. That were but a better reason, quoth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shahryar, for telling me the whole history, and I conjure thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,by Allah not to keep back aught from me. Thereupon Shah Zaman
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"told him all he had seen, from commencement to con elusion,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ending with these words, When I beheld thy calamity and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"treason of thy wife, O my brother, and I resected that thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in years my senior and in sovereignty my superior, mine own"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sorrow was belittled by the comparison, and my mind recovered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tone and temper: so throwing off melancholy and despondency, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was able to eat and drink and sleep, and thus I speedily regained"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,health and strength. Such is the truth and the whole truth. When
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King Shahryar heard this he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rage was like to strangle him; but presently he recovered himself
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, O my brother, I would not give thee the lie in this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"matter, but I cannot credit it till I see it with mine own eyes."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"An thou wouldst look upon thy calamity, quoth Shah Zaman, rise"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at once and make ready again for hunting and coursing.[FN#10] and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"then hide thyself with me, so shalt thou witness it and thine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eyes shall verify it. True, quoth the King; whereupon he let"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"make proclamation of his in tent to travel, and the troops and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tents fared forth without the city, camping within sight, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shahryar sallied out with them and took seat amidmost his host,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bidding the slaves admit no man to him. When night came on he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"summoned his Wazir and said to him, Sit thou in my stead and let"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,none wot of my absence till the term of three days. Then the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brothers disguised themselves and returned by night with all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"secrecy to the palace, where they passed the dark hours: and at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dawn they seated themselves at the lattice overlooking the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pleasure grounds, when presently the Queen and her handmaids came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out as before, and passing under the windows made for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fountain. Here they stripped, ten of them being men to ten women,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the King's wife cried out, Where art thou, O Saeed? The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hideous blackamoor dropped from the tree straightway; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rushing into her arms without stay or delay, cried out, I am"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sa'ad al Din Saood![FN#11] The lady laughed heartily, and all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell to satisfying their lusts, and remained so occupied for a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"couple of hours, when the white slaves rose up from the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,handmaidens' breasts and the blackamoor dismounted from the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Queen's bosom: then they went into the basin and, after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"performing the Ghusl, or complete ablution, donned their dresses"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and retired as they had done before. When King Shahryar saw this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,infamy of his wife and concubines he became as one distraught and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he cried out, Only in utter solitude can man be safe from the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"doings of this vile world! By Allah, life is naught but one great"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wrong. Presently he added, Do not thwart me, O my brother, in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what I propose; and the other answered, I will not. So he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, Let us up as we are and depart forthright hence, for we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have no concern with Kingship, and let us overwander Allah's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"earth, worshipping the Almighty till we find some one to whom the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,like calamity hath happened; and if we find none then will death
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be more welcome to us than life. So the two brothers issued from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a second private postern of the palace; and they never stinted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wayfaring by day and by night, until they reached a tree a middle"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of a meadow hard by a spring of sweet water on the shore of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,salt sea. Both drank of it and sat down to take their rest; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when an hour of the day had gone by: lo! they heard a mighty roar
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and uproar in the middle of the main as though the heavens were
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"falling upon the earth; and the sea brake with waves before them,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and from it towered a black pillar, which grew and grew till it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rose skywards and began making for that meadow. Seeing it, they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waxed fearful exceedingly and climbed to the top of the tree,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which was a lofty; whence they gazed to see what might be the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"matter. And behold, it was a Jinni,[FN#12] huge of height and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"burly of breast and bulk, broad of brow and black of blee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bearing on his head a coffer of crystal. He strode to land,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wading through the deep, and coming to the tree whereupon were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the two Kings, seated himself beneath it. He then set down the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"coffer on its bottom and out it drew a casket, with seven"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"padlocks of steel, which he unlocked with seven keys of steel he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"took from beside his thigh, and out of it a young lady to come"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was seen, white-skinned and of winsomest mien, of stature fine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and thin, and bright as though a moon of the fourteenth night she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had been, or the sun raining lively sheen. Even so the poet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Utayyah hath excellently said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,She rose like the morn as she shone through the night * And she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     gilded the grove with her gracious sight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,From her radiance the sun taketh increase when * She unveileth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and shameth the moonshine bright.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Bow down all beings between her hands * As she showeth charms
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     with her veil undight.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And she foodeth cities[FN#13] with torrent tears * When she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     flasheth her look of levee light.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Jinni seated her under the tree by his side and looking at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her said, O choicest love of this heart of mine! O dame of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"noblest line, whom I snatched away on thy bride night that none"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,might prevent me taking thy maidenhead or tumble thee before I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"did, and whom none save myself hath loved or hath enjoyed: O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sweetheart! I would fief sleep a little while. He then laid his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"head upon the lady's thighs; and, stretching out his legs which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"extended down to the sea, slept and snored and sparked like the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,roll of thunder. Presently she raised her head towards the tree
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,top and saw the two Kings perched near the summit; then she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,softly lifted off her lap the Jinni's pate which she was tired of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,supporting and placed it upon the ground; then standing upright
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"under the tree signed to the Kings, Come ye down, ye two, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fear naught from this Ifrit.[FN#14] They were in a terrible
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fright when they found that she had seen them and answered her in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the same manner, Allah upon thee[FN#15] and by thy modesty, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady, excuse us from coming down! But she rejoined by saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah upon you both, that ye come down forthright, and if ye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"come not, I will rouse upon you my husband, this Ifrit, and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shall do you to die by the illest of deaths; and she continued
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"making signals to them. So, being afraid, they came down to her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she rose be fore them and said, Stroke me a strong stroke,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"without stay or delay, otherwise will I arouse and set upon you"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this Ifrit who shall slay you straightway. They said to her, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"our lady, we conjure thee by Allah, let us off this work, for we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,are fugitives from such and in extreme dread and terror of this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy husband. How then can we do it in such a way as thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"desires? Leave this talk: it needs must be so; quoth she, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she swore them by Him[FN#16] who raised the skies on high,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"without prop or pillar, that, if they worked not her will, she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would cause them to be slain and cast into the sea. Whereupon out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of fear King Shahryar said to King Shah Zaman, O my brother, do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou what she biddeth thee do; but he replied, I will not do it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till thou do it before I do. And they began disputing about
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"futtering her. Then quoth she to the twain, How is it I see you"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disputing and demurring; if ye do not come forward like men and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"do the deed of kind ye two, I will arouse upon you the If rit."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"At this, by reason of their sore dread of the Jinni, both did by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her what she bade them do; and, when they had dismounted from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, she said, Well done! She then took from her pocket a purse"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and drew out a knotted string, whereon were strung five hundred"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and seventy[FN#17] seal rings, and asked, Know ye what be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"these? They answered her saying, We know not! Then quoth she;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,These be the signets of five hundred and seventy men who have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all futtered me upon the horns of this foul, this foolish, this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"filthy Ifrit; so give me also your two seal rings, ye pair of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brothers. When they had drawn their two rings from their hands
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and given them to her, she said to them, Of a truth this If rit"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bore me off on my bride night, and put me into a casket and set"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the casket in a coffer and to the coffer he affixed seven strong
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,padlocks of steel and deposited me on the deep bottom of the sea
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that raves, dashing and clashing with waves; and guarded me so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that I might remain chaste and honest, quotha! none save himself"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,might have connexion with me. But I have lain under as many of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kind as I please, and this wretched Jinni wotteth not that Des"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tiny may not be averted nor hindered by aught, and that whatso"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,woman willeth the same she fulfilleth however man nilleth. Even
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so saith one of them.--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Rely not on women; * Trust not to their hearts,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Whose joys and whose sorrows * Are hung to their parts!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Lying love they will swear thee * Whence guile ne'er departs:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Take Yusuf[FN#18] for sample * 'Ware sleights and 'ware smarts!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Iblis[FN#19] ousted Adam * (See ye not?) thro' their arts.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And another saith:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Stint thy blame, man! 'Twill drive to a passion without bound; *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     My fault is not so heavy as fault in it hast found.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If true lover I become, then to me there cometh not * Save what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     happened unto many in the bygone stound.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,For wonderful is he and right worthy of our praise * Who from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     wiles of female wits kept him safe and kept him sound.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hearing these words they marvelled with exceeding marvel, and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went from them to the Ifrit and, taking up his head on her thigh"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as before, said to them softly, Now wend your ways and bear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,yourselves beyond the bounds of his malice. So they fared forth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying either to other, Allah! Allah! and, There be no Majesty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and there be no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with Him we seek refuge from women's malice and sleight, for of a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"truth it hath no mate in might. Consider, O my brother, the ways"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of this marvellous lady with an Ifrit who is so much more
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,powerful than we are. Now since there hath hap pened to him a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,greater mishap than that which befel us and which should bear us
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"abundant consolation, so return we to our countries and capitals,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and let us decide never to intermarry with womankind and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,presently we will show them what will be our action. Thereupon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they rode back to the tents of King Shahryar, which they reached"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on the morning of the third day; and, having mustered the Wazirs"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and Emirs, the Chamberlains and high officials, he gave a robe of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,honour to his Viceroy and issued orders for an immediate return
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to the city. There he sat him upon his throne and sending for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Chief Minister, the father of the two damsels who (Inshallah!)"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will presently be mentioned, he said, I command thee to take my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wife and smite her to death; for she hath broken her plight and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her faith. So he carried her to the place of execution and did
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her die. Then King Shahryar took brand in hand and repairing to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Serraglio slew all the concubines and their Mamelukes.[FN#20]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,He also sware himself by a binding oath that whatever wife he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,married he would abate her maidenhead at night and slay her next
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"morning to make sure of his honour; For, said he, there never"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was nor is there one chaste woman upon face of earth. Then Shah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Zaman prayed for permission to fare homewards; and he went forth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,equipped and escorted and travelled till he reached his own
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,country. Mean while Shahryar commanded his Wazir to bring him the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bride of the night that he might go in to her; so he produced a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"most beautiful girl, the daughter of one of the Emirs and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King went in unto her at eventide and when morning dawned he bade
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his Minister strike off her head; and the Wazir did accordingly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for fear of the Sultan. On this wise he continued for the space
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of three years; marrying a maiden every night and killing her the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"next morning, till folk raised an outcry against him and cursed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, praying Allah utterly to destroy him and his rule; and women"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made an uproar and mothers wept and parents fled with their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,daughters till there remained not in the city a young person fit
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for carnal copulation. Presently the King ordered his Chief
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir, the same who was charged with the executions, to bring him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a virgin as was his wont; and the Minister went forth and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,searched and found none; so he returned home in sorrow and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,anxiety fearing for his life from the King. Now he had two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughters, Shahrazad and Dunyazad hight,[FN#21] of whom the elder"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had perused the books, annals and legends of preceding Kings, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the stories, examples and instances of by gone men and things;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,indeed it was said that she had collected a thousand books of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,histories relating to antique races and departed rulers. She had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perused the works of the poets and knew them by heart; she had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"studied philosophy and the sciences, arts and accomplish meets;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she was pleasant and polite, wise and witty, well read and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"well bred. Now on that day she said to her father, Why do I see"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee thus changed and laden with cark and care? Concerning this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,matter quoth one of the poets.--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Tell whoso hath sorrow     * Grief never shall last:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     E'en as joy hath no morrow * So woe shall go past.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the Wazir heard from his daughter these words he related to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, from first to last, all that had happened between him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King. Thereupon said she, By Allah, O my father, how long"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shall this slaughter of women endure? Shall I tell thee what is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in my mind in order to save both sides from destruction? Say
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on, O my daughter, quoth he, and quoth she, I wish thou wouldst"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,give me in marriage to this King Shahryar; either I shall live or
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I shall be a ransom for the virgin daughters of Moslems and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cause of their deliverance from his hands and thine.[FN#22]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah upon thee! cried he in wrath exceeding that lacked no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feeding, O scanty of wit, expose not thy life to such peril! How"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,durst thou address me in words so wide from wisdom and un far
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from foolishness? Know that one who lacketh experience in worldly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,matters readily falleth into misfortune; and whoso considereth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not the end keepeth not the world to friend, and the vulgar say:-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,-I was lying at mine ease: nought but my officiousness brought me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unease. Needs must thou, she broke in, make me a doer of this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"good deed, and let him kill me an he will: I shall only die a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ransom for others. O my daughter, asked he, and how shall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that profit thee when thou shalt have thrown away thy life? and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she answered, O my father it must be, come of it what will! The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir was again moved to fury and blamed and reproached her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ending with, In very deed--I fear lest the same befal thee which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befel the Bull and the Ass with the Husband man. And what,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asked she, befel them, O my father? Whereupon the Wazir began"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,              Tale of the Bull[FN#23] and the Ass.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O my daughter, that there was once a merchant who owned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"much money and many men, and who was rich in cattle and camels;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he had also a wife and family and he dwelt in the country, being"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,experienced in husbandry and devoted to agriculture. Now Allah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Most High had endowed him with under standing the tongues of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beasts and birds of every kind, but under pain of death if he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,divulged the gift to any. So he kept it secret for very fear. He
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had in his cow house a Bull and an Ass each tethered in his own
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stall one hard by the other. As the merchant was sitting near
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hand one day with his servants and his children were playing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"about him, he heard the Bull say to the Ass, Hail and health to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee O Father of Waking![FN#24] for that thou enjoyest rest and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,good ministering; all under thee is clean swept and fresh
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sprinkled; men wait upon thee and feed thee, and thy provaunt is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sifted barley and thy drink pure spring water, while I (unhappy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"creature!) am led forth in the middle of the night, when they set"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on my neck the plough and a something called Yoke; and I tire at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cleaving the earth from dawn of day till set of sun. I am forced
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to do more than I can and to bear all manner of ill treatment
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from night to night; after which they take me back with my sides
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"torn, my neck flayed, my legs aching and mine eyelids sored with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tears. Then they shut me up in the byre and throw me beans and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crushed straw,[FN#25] mixed with dirt and chaff; and I lie in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dung and filth and foul stinks through the livelong night. But
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou art ever in a place swept and sprinkled and cleansed, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou art always lying at ease, save when it happens (and seldom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"enough!) that the master hath some business, when he mounts thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and rides thee to town and returns with thee forthright. So it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,happens that I am toiling and distress while thou takest thine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ease and thy rest; thou sleepest while I am sleepless; I hunger
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"still while thou eatest thy fill, and I win contempt while thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"winnest good will. When the Bull ceased speaking, the Ass turned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to wards him and said, O Broad o' Brow,[FN#26] 0 thou lost one!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he lied not who dubbed thee Bull head, for thou, O father of a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bull, hast neither forethought nor contrivance; thou art the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"simplest of simpletons,[FN#27] and thou knowest naught of good"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,advisers. Hast thou not heard the saying of the wise:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,For others these hardships and labours I bear * And theirs is the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pleasure and mine is the care;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,As the bleacher who blacketh his brow in the sun * To whiten the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     raiment which other men wear.[FN#28]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But thou, O fool, art full of zeal and thou toilest and moilest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before the master; and thou tearest and wearest and slayest thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,self for the comfort of another. Hast thou never heard the saw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that saith, None to guide and from the way go wide? Thou wendest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth at the call to dawn prayer and thou returnest not till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sundown; and through the livelong day thou endurest all manner
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hardships; to wit, beating and belabouring and bad language. Now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hearken to me, Sir Bull! when they tie thee to thy stinking"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"manger, thou pawest the ground with thy forehand and rashest out"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with thy hind hoofs and pushest with thy horns and bellowest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"aloud, so they deem thee contented. And when they throw thee thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fodder thou fallest on it with greed and hastenest to line thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fair fat paunch. But if thou accept my advice it will be better
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for thee and thou wilt lead an easier life even than mine. When
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou goest a field and they lay the thing called Yoke on thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neck, lie down and rise not again though haply they swinge thee;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, if thou rise, lie down a second time; and when they bring"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee home and offer thee thy beans, fall backwards and only sniff"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at thy meat and withdraw thee and taste it not, and be satis fied"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with thy crushed straw and chaff; and on this wise feign thou art
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sick, and cease not doing thus for a day or two days or even"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"three days, so shalt thou have rest from toil and moil. When the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Bull heard these words he knew the Ass to be his friend and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thanked him, saying, Right is thy rede; and prayed that all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blessings might requite him, and cried, O Father Wakener![FN#29]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou hast made up for my failings. (Now[FN#30] the merchant, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my daughter, understood all that passed between them.) Next day"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the driver took the Bull, and settling the plough on his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neck,[FN#31] made him work as wont; but the Bull began to shirk"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his ploughing, according to the advice of the Ass, and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ploughman drubbed him till he broke the yoke and made off; but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the man caught him up and leathered him till he despaired of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"life. Not the less, however, would he do nothing but stand still"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and drop down till the evening. Then the herd led him home and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stabled him in his stall: but he drew back from his manger and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,neither stamped nor ramped nor butted nor bellowed as he was wont
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to do; whereat the man wondered. He brought him the beans and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"husks, but he sniffed at them and left them and lay down as far"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from them as he could and passed the whole night fasting. The
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"peasant came next morning; and, seeing the manger full of beans,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the crushed straw untasted and the ox lying on his back in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sorriest plight, with legs outstretched and swollen belly, he was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"concerned for him, and said to himself, By Allah, he hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,assuredly sickened and this is the cause why he would not plough
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yesterday. Then he went to the merchant and reported, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"master, the Bull is ailing; he refused his fodder last night; nay"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"more, he hath not tasted a scrap of it this morning. Now the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchant farmer understood what all this meant, because he had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"overheard the talk between the Bull and the Ass, so quoth he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Take that rascal donkey, and set the yoke on his neck, and bind"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him to the plough and make him do Bull's work. Thereupon the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ploughman took the Ass, and worked him through the live long day"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at the Bull's task; and, when he failed for weakness, he made him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eat stick till his ribs were sore and his sides were sunken and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his neck was hayed by the yoke; and when he came home in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"evening he could hardly drag his limbs along, either fore hand or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hind legs. But as for the Bull, he had passed the day lying at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"full length and had eaten his fodder with an excellent appetite,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he ceased not calling down blessings on the Ass for his good
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"advice, unknowing what had come to him on his ac count. So when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,night set in and the Ass returned to the byte the Bull rose up
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before him in honour, and said, May good tidings gladden thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heart, O Father Wakener! through thee I have rested all this day"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I have eaten my meat in peace and quiet. But the Ass
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned no reply, for wrath and heart burning and fatigue and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the beating he had gotten; and he repented with the most grievous
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of repentance; and quoth he to himself: This cometh of my folly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in giving good counsel; as the saw saith, I was in joy and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gladness, nought save my officiousness brought me this sadness."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,But I will bear in mind my innate worth and the nobility of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nature; for what saith the poet?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Shall the beautiful hue of the Basil[FN#32] fail * Tho' the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     beetle's foot o'er the Basil crawl?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And though spider and fly be its denizens * Shall disgrace attach
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     to the royal hall?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The cowrie,[FN#33] I ken, shall have currency * But the pearl's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     clear drop, shall its value fall?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And now I must take thought and put a trick upon him and return
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him to his place, else I die. Then he went aweary to his manger,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"while the Bull thanked him and blessed him. And even so, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter, said the Wazir, thou wilt die for lack of wits;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,therefore sit thee still and say naught and expose not thy life
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to such stress; for, by Allah, I offer thee the best advice,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which cometh of my affection and kindly solicitude for thee. O
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my father, she answered, needs must I go up to this King and be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"married to him. Quoth he, Do not this deed; and quoth she, Of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a truth I will: whereat he rejoined, If thou be not silent and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bide still, I will do with thee even what the merchant did with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his wife. And what did he? asked she. Know then, answered the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir, that after the return of the Ass the merchant came out on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the terrace roof with his wife and family, for it was a moonlit"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,night and the moon at its full. Now the ter race overlooked the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cowhouse and presently, as he sat there with his children playing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"about him, the trader heard the Ass say to the Bull, Tell me, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Father Broad o' Brow, what thou purposest to do to morrow? The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bull answered, What but continue to follow thy counsel, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Aliboron? Indeed it was as good as good could be and it hath
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,given me rest and repose; nor will I now depart from it one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"little: so, when they bring me my meat, I will refuse it and blow"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out my belly and counterfeit crank. The Ass shook his head and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, Beware of so doing, O Father of a Bull! The Bull asked,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Why, and the Ass answered, Know that I am about to give thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the best of counsel, for verily I heard our owner say to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"herd, If the Bull rise not from his place to do his work this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"morning and if he retire from his fodder this day, make him over"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to the butcher that he may slaughter him and give his flesh to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the poor, and fashion a bit of leather[FN#34] from his hide. Now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I fear for thee on account of this. So take my advice ere a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,calamity befal thee; and when they bring thee thy fodder eat it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and rise up and bellow and paw the ground, or our master will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,assuredly slay thee: and peace be with thee! Thereupon the Bull
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arose and lowed aloud and thanked the Ass, and said, To morrow I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will readily go forth with them; and he at once ate up all his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,meat and even licked the manger. (All this took place and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,owner was listening to their talk.) Next morning the trader and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his wife went to the Bull's crib and sat down, and the driver"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came and led forth the Bull who, seeing his owner, whisked his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tail and brake wind, and frisked about so lustily that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,merchant laughed a loud laugh and kept laughing till he fell on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his back. His wife asked him, Whereat laughest thou with such"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loud laughter as this?; and he answered her, I laughed at a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,secret something which I have heard and seen but cannot say lest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I die my death. She returned, Perforce thou must discover it to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, and disclose the cause of thy laughing even if thou come by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy death! But he rejoined, I cannot re veal what beasts and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"birds say in their lingo for fear I die. Then quoth she, By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, thou liest! this is a mere pretext: thou laughest at none"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"save me, and now thou wouldest hide somewhat from me. But by the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Lord of the Heavens! an thou disclose not the cause I will no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,longer cohabit with thee: I will leave thee at once. And she sat
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"down and cried. Whereupon quoth the merchant, Woe betide thee!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what means thy weeping? Bear Allah and leave these words and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,query me no more questions. Needs must thou tell me the cause
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of that laugh, said she, and he replied, Thou wottest that when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I prayed Allah to vouchsafe me understanding of the tongues of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beasts and birds, I made a vow never to disclose the secret to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"any under pain of dying on the spot. No matter, cried she,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tell me what secret passed between the Bull and the Ass and die
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this very hour an thou be so minded; and she ceased not to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,importune him till he was worn out and clean distraught. So at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"last he said, Summon thy father and thy mother and our kith and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kin and sundry of our neighbours, which she did; and he sent for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Kazi[FN#35] and his assessors, intending to make his will and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,reveal to her his secret and die the death; for he loved her with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"love exceeding because she was his cousin, the daughter of his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"father's brother, and the mother of his children, and he had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lived with her a life of an hundred and twenty years. Then,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,having assembled all the family and the folk of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neighbourhood, he said to them, By me there hangeth a strange"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"story, and 'tis such that if I discover the secret to any, I am a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dead man. Therefore quoth every one of those present to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"woman, Allah upon thee, leave this sinful obstinacy and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"recognise the right of this matter, lest haply thy husband and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the father of thy children die. But she rejoined, I will not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"turn from it till he tell me, even though he come by his death."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So they ceased to urge her; and the trader rose from amongst them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and repaired to an out house to per form Wuzu ablution,[FN#36]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he purposed thereafter to return and to tell them his secret
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and to die. Now, daughter Shahrazad, that mer chant had in his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out houses some fifty hens under one cock, and whilst making"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ready to farewell his folk he heard one of his many farm dogs
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thus address in his own tongue the Cock, who was flapping his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wings and crowing lustily and jumping from one hen's back to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"another and treading all in turn, saying O Chanti clear! how"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mean is thy wit and how shameless is thy conduct! Be he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disappointed who brought thee up![FN#37] Art thou not ashamed of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy doings on such a day as this! And what, asked the Rooster,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hath occurred this day? when the Dog answered, Doss thou not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,know that our master is this day making ready for his death? His
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wife is resolved that he shall disclose the secret taught to him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"by Allah, and the moment he so doeth he shall surely die. We dogs"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,are all a mourning; but thou clappest thy wings and clarionest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy loudest and treadest hen after hen. Is this an hour for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pastime and pleasuring? Art thou not ashamed of thyself?[FN#38]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then by Allah, quoth the Cock, is our master a lack wit and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,man scanty of sense: if he cannot manage matters with a single
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wife, his life is not worth prolonging. Now I have some fifty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Dame Partlets; and I please this and provoke that and starve one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and stuff another; and through my good governance they are all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,well under my control. This our master pretendeth to wit and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wisdom, and he hath but one wife, and yet knoweth not how to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"manage her. Asked the Dog, What then, O Cock, should the master"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"do to win clear of his strait? He should arise forthright,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered the Cock, and take some twigs from yon mulberry tree"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and give her a regular back basting and rib roasting till she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cry:--I repent, O my lord! I will never ask thee a question as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"long as I live! Then let him beat her once more and soundly, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when he shall have done this he shall sleep free from care and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,enjoy life. But this master of ours owns neither sense nor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"judgment. Now, daughter Shahrazad, continued the Wazir, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will do to thee as did that husband to that wife. Said
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shahrazad, And what did he do? He replied, When the merchant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard the wise words spoken by his Cock to his Dog, he arose in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"haste and sought his wife's chamber, after cutting for her some"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mulberry twigs and hiding them there; and then he called to her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Come into the closet that I may tell thee the secret while no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one seeth me and then die. She entered with him and he locked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the door and came down upon her with so sound a beating of back
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and shoulders, ribs, arms and legs, saying the while, Wilt thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ever be asking questions about what concerneth thee not? that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she was well nigh senseless. Presently she cried out, I am of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the repentant! By Allah, I will ask thee no more questions, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,indeed I repent sincerely and wholesomely. Then she kissed his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hand and feet and he led her out of the room submissive as a wife
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,should be. Her parents and all the company rejoiced and sadness
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and mourn ing were changed into joy and gladness. Thus the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,merchant learnt family discipline from his Cock and he and his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wife lived together the happiest of lives until death. And thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"also, O my daughter! continued the Wazir, Unless thou turn from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this matter I will do by thee what that trader did to his wife.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But she answered him with much decision, I will never desist, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my father, nor shall this tale change my purpose. Leave such talk"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and tattle. I will not listen to thy words and, if thou deny me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I will marry myself to him despite the nose of thee. And first I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will go up to the King myself and alone and I will say to him:--I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prayed my father to wive me with thee, but he refused being"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"resolved to disappoint his lord, grudging the like of me to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like of thee. Her father asked, Must this needs be? and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, Even so. Hereupon the Wazir being weary of lamenting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and contending, persuading and dissuading her, all to no purpose,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went up to King Shahryar and after blessing him and kissing the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ground before him, told him all about his dispute with his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,daughter from first to last and how he designed to bring her to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him that night. The King wondered with exceeding wonder; for he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had made an especial exception of the Wazir's daughter, and said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to him, O most faithful of Counsellors, how is this? Thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wottest that I have sworn by the Raiser of the Heavens that after
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I have gone in to her this night I shall say to thee on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"morrow's morning:--Take her and slay her! and, if thou slay her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not, I will slay thee in her stead without fail. Allah guide"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee to glory and lengthen thy life, O King of the age, answered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Wazir, it is she that hath so determined: all this have I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,told her and more; but she will not hearken to me and she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,persisteth in passing this coming night with the King's Majesty.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So Shahryar rejoiced greatly and said, 'Tis well; go get her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ready and this night bring her to me. The Wazir returned to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter and reported to her the command saying, Allah make not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy father desolate by thy loss! But Shah razed rejoiced with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,exceeding joy and get ready all she required and said to her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"younger sister, Dunyazad, Note well what directions I entrust to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee! When I have gone in to the King I will send for thee and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when thou comest to me and seest that he hath had his carnal will
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of me, do thou say to me:--O my sister, an thou be not sleepy,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"relate to me some new story, delectable and delightsome, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,better to speed our waking hours; and I will tell thee a tale
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which shall be our deliverance, if so Allah please, and which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shall turn the King from his blood thirsty custom. Dunyazad
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,answered With love and gladness. So when it was night their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,father the Wazir carried Shahrazad to the King who was gladdened
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at the sight and asked, Hast thou brought me my need? and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, I have. But when the King took her to his bed and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fell to toying with her and wished to go in to her she wept;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which made him ask, What aileth thee? She replied, O King of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the age, I have a younger sister and fief would I take leave of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her this night before I see the dawn. So he sent at once for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Dunyazad and she came and kissed the ground between his hands,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when he permitted her to take her seat near the foot of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,couch. Then the King arose and did away with his bride's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,maidenhead and the three fell asleep. But when it was midnight
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Shahrazad awoke and signalled to her sister Dunyazad who sat up
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, Allah upon thee, O my sister, recite to us some new"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"story, delightsome and delectable, wherewith to while away the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,waking hours of our latter night.[FN#39] With joy and goodly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gree, answered Shahrazad, if this pious and auspicious King"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"permit me. Tell on, quoth the King who chanced to be sleepless"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and restless and therefore was pleased with the prospect of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hearing her story. So Shahrazad rejoiced; and thus, on the first"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night of the Thousand Nights and a Night, she began with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,               TALE OF THE TRADER AND THE JINNI.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"It is related, O auspicious King, that there was a merchant of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the merchants who had much wealth, and business in various"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cities. Now on a day he mounted horse and went forth to re cover
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"monies in certain towns, and the heat sore oppressed him; so he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sat beneath a tree and, putting his hand into his saddle bags,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took thence some broken bread and dry dates and began to break
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his fast. When he had ended eating the dates he threw away the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stones with force and lo! an Ifrit appeared, huge of stature and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brandishing a drawn sword, wherewith he approached the mer chant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, Stand up that I may slay thee, even as thou slewest my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son! Asked the merchant, How have I slain thy son? and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, When thou atest dates and threwest away the stones"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they struck my son full in the breast as he was walking by, so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that he died forthwith.[FN#40] Quoth the merchant, Verily from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah we proceeded and unto Allah are we re turning. There is no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Majesty, and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Great! If I slew thy son, I slew him by chance medley. I pray"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee now pardon me. Rejoined the Jinni, There is no help but I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"must slay thee. Then he seized him and dragged him along and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"casting him to the earth, raised the sword to strike him;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereupon the merchant wept, and said, I commit my case to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, and began repeating these couplets:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Containeth Time a twain of days, this of blessing that of bane *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     And holdeth Life a twain of halves, this of pleasure that of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"See'st not when blows the hurricane, sweeping stark and striking"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     strong * None save the forest giant feels the suffering of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     the strain?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,How many trees earth nourisheth of the dry and of the green *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Yet none but those which bear the fruits for cast of stone
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     complain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,See'st not how corpses rise and float on the surface of the tide
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     * While pearls o'price lie hidden in the deepest of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     main!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,In Heaven are unnumbered the many of the stars * Yet ne'er a star
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     but Sun and Moon by eclipse is overta'en.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Well judgedst thou the days that saw thy faring sound and well *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     And countedst not the pangs and pain whereof Fate is ever
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The nights have kept thee safe and the safety brought thee pride
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     * But bliss and blessings of the night are 'genderers of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bane!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the merchant ceased repeating his verses the Jinni said to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, Cut thy words short, by Allah! needs must I slay thee. But"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the merchant spake him thus, Know, O thou Ifrit, that I have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,debts due to me and much wealth and children and a wife and many
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pledges in hand; so permit me to go home and dis charge to every
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,claimant his claim; and I will come back to thee at the head of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the new year. Allah be my testimony and surety that I will return
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to thee; and then thou mayest do with me as thou wilt and Allah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is witness to what I say. The Jinni took sure promise of him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,let him go; so he returned to his own city and transacted his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,business and rendered to all men their dues and after informing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his wife and children of what had betided him, he appointed a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"guardian and dwelt with them for a full year. Then he arose, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made the Wuzu ablution to purify himself before death and took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his shroud under his arm and bade farewell to his people, his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neighbours and all his kith and kin, and went forth despite his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,own nose.[FN#41] They then began weeping and wailing and beating
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their breasts over him; but he travelled until he arrived at the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"same garden, and the day of his arrival was the head of the New"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Year. As he sat weeping over what had befallen him, behold, a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shaykh,[FN#42] a very ancient man, drew near leading a chained"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gazelle; and he saluted that merchant and wishing him long life
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, What is the cause of thy sitting in this place and thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,alone and this be a resort of evil spirits? The merchant related
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to him what had come to pass with the Ifrit, and the old man, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"owner of the gazelle, wondered and said, By Allah, O brother,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy faith is none other than exceeding faith and thy story right
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"strange; were it graven with gravers on the eye corners, it were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a warner to whoso would be warned. Then seating himself near the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchant he said, By Allah, O my brother, I will not leave thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,until I see what may come to pass with thee and this Ifrit. And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,presently as he sat and the two were at talk the merchant began
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to feel fear and terror and exceeding grief and sorrow beyond
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,relief and ever growing care and extreme despair. And the owner
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the gazelle was hard by his side; when behold, a second Shaykh"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"approached them, and with him were two dogs both of greyhound"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,breed and both black. The second old man after saluting them with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the salam, also asked them of their tidings and said What"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"causeth you to sit in this place, a dwelling of the Jann?[FN#43]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So they told him the tale from beginning to end, and their stay"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there had not lasted long before there came up a third Shaykh,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and with him a she mule of bright bay coat; and he saluted them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and asked them why they were seated in that place. So they told
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him the story from first to last: and of no avail, O my master,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is a twice told tale! There he sat down with them, and lo! a dust"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cloud advanced and a mighty send devil appeared amidmost of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waste. Presently the cloud opened and behold, within it was that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Jinni hending in hand a drawn sword, while his eyes were shooting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fire sparks of rage. He came up to them and, haling away the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchant from among them, cried to him, Arise that I may slay"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee, as thou slewest my son, the life stuff of my liver.[FN#44]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The merchant wailed and wept, and the three old men began sighing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and crying and weeping and wailing with their companion.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Presently the first old man (the owner of the gazelle) came out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from among them and kissed the hand of the Ifrit and said, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Jinni, thou Crown of the Kings of the Jann! were I to tell thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the story of me and this gazelle and thou shouldst consider it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wondrous wouldst thou give me a third part of this merchant's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blood? Then quoth the Jinni Even so, O Shaykh ! if thou tell me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this tale, and I hold it a marvellous, then will I give thee a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,third of his blood. Thereupon the old man began to tell
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The First Shaykh's Story.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Know O Jinni! that this gazelle is the daughter of my paternal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"uncle, my own flesh and blood, and I married her when she was a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young maid, and I lived with her well nigh thirty years, yet was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I not blessed with issue by her. So I took me a concubine[FN#45]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who brought to me the boon of a male child fair as the full moon,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with eyes of lovely shine and eyebrows which formed one line, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,limbs of perfect design. Little by little he grew in stature and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waxed tall; and when he was a lad fifteen years old, it became"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,needful I should journey to certain cities and I travelled with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,great store of goods. But the daughter of my uncle (this gazelle)
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had learned gramarye and egromancy and clerkly craft[FN#46] from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her childhood; so she bewitched that son of mine to a calf, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my handmaid (his mother) to a heifer, and made them over to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,herdsman's care. Now when I returned after a long time from my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"journey and asked for my son and his mother, she answered me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying Thy slave girl is dead, and thy son hath fled and I know"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not whither he is sped. So I remained for a whole year with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grieving heart, and streaming eyes until the time came for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Great Festival of Allah.[FN#47] Then sent I to my herdsman bidding
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him choose for me a fat heifer; and he brought me one which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was the damsel, my handmaid, whom this gazelle had ensorcelled. I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tucked up my sleeves and skirt and, taking a knife, proceeded to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cut her throat, but she lowed aloud and wept bitter tears."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thereat I marvelled and pity seized me and I held my hand, saying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the herd, Bring me other than this. Then cried my cousin,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Slay her, for I have not a fatter nor a fairer! Once more I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went forward to sacrifice her, but she again lowed aloud upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which in ruth I refrained and commanded the herdsman to slay her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and flay her. He killed her and skinned her but found in her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neither fat nor flesh, only hide and bone; and I repented when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,penitence availed me naught. I gave her to the herdsman and said
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to him, Fetch me a fat calf; so he brought my son ensorcelled."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When the calf saw me, he brake his tether and ran to me, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fawned upon me and wailed and shed tears; so that I took pity on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him and said to the herdsman, Bring me a heifer and let this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"calf go! Thereupon my cousin (this gazelle) called aloud at me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, Needs must thou kill this calf; this is a holy day and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blessed, whereon naught is slain save what be perfect pure; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,we have not amongst our calves any fatter or fairer than this!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth I, Look thou upon the condition of the heifer which I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slaughtered at thy bidding and how we turn from her in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disappointment and she profited us on no wise; and I repent with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,an exceeding repentance of having killed her: so this time I will
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not obey thy bidding for the sacrifice of this calf. Quoth she,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah the Most Great, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there is no help for it; thou must kill him on this holy day, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,if thou kill him not to me thou art no man and I to thee am no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wife. Now when I heard those hard words, not knowing her object"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I went up to the calf, knife in hand--And Shahrazad perceived the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.[FN#48] Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth her sister to her, How fair is thy tale, and how grateful,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and how sweet and how tasteful! And Shahrazad answered her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"What is this to that I could tell thee on the coming night, were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I to live and the King would spare me? Then said the King in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself, By Allah, I will not slay her, until I shall have heard"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the rest of her tale. So they slept the rest of that night in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mutual em brace till day fully brake. Then the King went forth to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his audience hall[FN#49] and the Wazir went up with his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter's shroud under his arm. The King issued his orders, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"promoted this and deposed that, until the end of the day; and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,told the Wazir no whit of what had happened. But the Minister
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wondered thereat with exceeding wonder; and when the Court broke
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up King Shahryar entered his palace.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                 When it was the Second Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said Dunyazad to her sister Shahrazad, O my sister, finish for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,us that story of the Merchant and the Jinni; and she answered
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"With joy and goodly gree, if the King permit me. Then quoth the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King, Tell thy tale; and Shahrazad began in these words: It"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hath reached me, O auspicious King and Heaven directed Ruler!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that when the merchant purposed the sacrifice of the calf but saw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it weeping, his heart relented and he said to the herdsman, Keep"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the calf among my cattle. All this the old Shaykh told the Jinni
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who marvelled much at these strange words. Then the owner of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gazelle continued:--O Lord of the Kings of the Jann, this much"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"took place and my uncle's daughter, this gazelle, looked on and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw it, and said, Butcher me this calf, for surely it is a fat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one; but I bade the herdsman take it away and he took it and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,turned his face homewards. On the next day as I was sitting in my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"own house, lo! the herdsman came and, standing before me said, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my master, I will tell thee a thing which shall gladden thy soul,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and shall gain me the gift of good tidings.[FN#50] I answered,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Even so. Then said he, O merchant, I have a daughter, and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,learned magic in her childhood from an old woman who lived with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us. Yesterday when thou gavest me the calf, I went into the house"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to her, and she looked upon it and veiled her face; then she wept"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and laughed alternately and at last she said:--O my father, hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mine honour become so cheap to thee that thou bringest in to me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,strange men? I asked her:--Where be these strange men and why
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wast thou laughing, and crying?; and she answered, Of a truth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this calf which is with thee is the son of our master, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,merchant; but he is ensorcelled by his stepdame who bewitched
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,both him and his mother: such is the cause of my laughing; now
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the reason of his weeping is his mother, for that his father slew"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her unawares. Then I marvelled at this with exceeding marvel and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hardly made sure that day had dawned before I came to tell thee.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I heard, O Jinni, my herdsman's words, I went out with him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I was drunken without wine, from the excess of joy and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gladness which came upon me, until I reached his house. There his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter welcomed me and kissed my hand, and forthwith the calf"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came and fawned upon me as before. Quoth I to the herdsman's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter, Is this true that thou sayest of this calf? Quoth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she, Yea, O my master, he is thy son, the very core of thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heart. I rejoiced and said to her, O maiden, if thou wilt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,release him thine shall be whatever cattle and property of mine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"are under thy father's hand. She smiled and answered, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"master, I have no greed for the goods nor will I take them save"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on two conditions; the first that thou marry me to thy son and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the second that I may bewitch her who bewitched him and imprison
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, otherwise I cannot be safe from her malice and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"malpractices. Now when I heard, O Jinni, these, the words of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"herdsman's daughter, I replied, Beside what thou askest all the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cattle and the house hold stuff in thy father's charge are thine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, as for the daughter of my uncle, her blood is lawful to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee. When I had spoken, she took a cup and filled it with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,water: then she recited a spell over it and sprinkled it upon the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"calf, saying, If Almighty Allah created thee a calf, remain so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shaped, and change not; but if thou be enchanted, return to thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whilom form, by command of Allah Most Highest! and lo! he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"trembled and became a man. Then I fell on his neck and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah upon thee, tell me all that the daughter of my uncle did"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,by thee and by thy mother. And when he told me what had come to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pass between them I said,  O my son, Allah favoured thee with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one to restore thee, and thy right hath returned to thee. Then,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O Jinni, I married the herdsman's daughter to him, and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"transformed my wife into this gazelle, saying:--Her shape is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,comely and by no means loathsome. After this she abode with us
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night and day, day and night, till the Almighty took her to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Himself. When she deceased, my son fared forth to the cities of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hind, even to the city of this man who hath done to thee what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hath been done;[FN#51] and I also took this gazelle (my cousin)
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and wandered with her from town to town seeking tidings of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son, till Destiny drove me to this place where I saw the merchant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sitting in tears. Such is my tale! Quoth the Jinni, This story"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is indeed strange, and therefore I grant thee the third part of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his blood. There upon the second old man, who owned the two"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"greyhounds, came up and said,  O Jinni, if I recount to thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what befel me from my brothers, these two hounds, and thou see"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that it is a tale even more wondrous and marvellous than what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou hast heard, wilt thou grant to me also the third of this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man's blood? Replied the Jinni, Thou hast my word for it, if"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thine adventures be more marvellous and wondrous. Thereupon he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thus began
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Second Shaykh's Story.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O lord of the Kings of the Jann! that these two dogs are my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brothers and I am the third. Now when our father died and left us
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a capital of three thousand gold pieces,[FN#52] I opened a shop"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with my share, and bought and sold therein, and in like guise did"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my two brothers, each setting up a shop. But I had been in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,business no long while before the elder sold his stock for a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thousand diners, and after buying outfit and merchandise, went"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his ways to foreign parts. He was absent one whole year with the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"caravan; but one day as I sat in my shop, behold, a beggar stood"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before me asking alms, and I said to him, Allah open thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"another door![FN#53] Whereupon he answered, weeping the while,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Am I so changed that thou knowest me not? Then I looked at him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"narrowly, and lo! it was my brother, so I rose to him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,welcomed him; then I seated him in my shop and put questions
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"concerning his case. Ask me not, answered he; my wealth is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,awaste and my state hath waxed unstated! So I took him to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hammam bath[FN#54] and clad him in a suit of my own and gave him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lodging in my house. Moreover, after looking over the accounts of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my stock in trade and the profits of my business, I found that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"industry had gained me one thousand diners, while my principal,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the head of my wealth, amounted to two thousand. So I shared the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whole with him saying, Assume that thou hast made no journey"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,abroad but hast remained at home; and be not cast down by thine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ill luck. He took the share in great glee and opened for himself
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a shop; and matters went on quietly for a few nights and days.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But presently my second brother (yon other dog), also setting his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heart upon travel, sold off what goods and stock in trade he had,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and albeit we tried to stay him he would not be stayed: he laid
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in an outfit for the journey and fared forth with certain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wayfarers. After an absence of a whole year he came back to me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"even as my elder brother had come back; and when I said to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my brother, did I not dissuade thee from travel? he shed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tears and cried, O my brother, this be destiny's decree: here I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"am a mere beggar, penniless[FN#55] and without a shirt to my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"back. So I led him to the bath, O Jinni, and clothing him in new"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clothes of my own wear, I went with him to my shop and served him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with meat and drink. Furthermore I said to him, O my brother, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"am wont to cast up my shop accounts at the head of every year,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and whatso I shall find of surplusage is between me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee.[FN#56] So I proceeded, O Ifrit, to strike a balance and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"finding two thousand diners of profit, I returned praises to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Creator (be He extolled and exalted!) and made over one half to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my brother, keeping the other to my self. Thereupon he busied"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,himself with opening a shop and on this wise we abode many days.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,After a time my brothers began pressing me to travel with them;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but I refused saying, What gained ye by travel voyage that I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,should gain thereby? As I would not give ear to them we went
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,back each to his own shop where we bought and sold as before.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"They kept urging me to travel for a whole twelvemonth, but I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,refused to do so till full six years were past and gone when I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"consented with these words, O my brothers, here am I, your"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,companion of travel: now let me see what monies you have by you.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I found, however, that they had not a doit, having squandered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their substance in high diet and drinking and carnal delights.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Yet I spoke not a word of reproach; so far from it I looked over
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my shop accounts once more, and sold what goods and stock in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"trade were mine; and, finding myself the owner of six thousand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ducats, I gladly proceeded to divide that sum in halves, saying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to my brothers, These three thousand gold pieces are for me and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for you to trade withal, adding, Let us bury the other moiety"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"underground that it may be of service in case any harm befal us,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in which case each shall take a thousand wherewith to open
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shops. Both replied, Right is thy recking; and I gave to each"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one his thousand gold pieces, keeping the same sum for myself, to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wit, a thousand diners. We then got ready suitable goods and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hired a ship and, having embarked our merchandise, proceeded on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"our voyage, day following day, a full month, after which we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arrived at a city, where we sold our venture; and for every piece"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of gold we gained ten. And as we turned again to our voyage we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,found on the shore of the sea a maiden clad in worn and ragged
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gear, and she kissed my hand and said, O master, is there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kindness in thee and charity? I can make thee a fitting return
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for them. I answered, Even so; truly in me are benevolence and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"good works, even though thou render me no return. Then she said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Take me to wife, O my master, and carry me to thy city, for I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have given myself to thee; so do me a kindness and I am of those
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who be meet for good works and charity: I will make thee a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fitting return for these and be thou not shamed by my condition.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I heard her words, my heart yearned towards her, in such"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sort as willed it Allah (be He extolled and exalted!); and took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her and clothed her and made ready for her a fair resting place
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in the vessel, and honourably entreated her. So we voyaged on,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and my heart became attached to her with exceeding attachment,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I was separated from her neither night nor day, and I paid"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,more regard to her than to my brothers. Then they were estranged
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from me, and waxed jealous of my wealth and the quantity of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchandise I had, and their eyes were opened covetously upon all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my property. So they took counsel to murder me and seize my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wealth, saying, Let us slay our brother and all his monies will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be ours; and Satan made this deed seem fair in their sight; so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when they found me in privacy (and I sleeping by my wife's side)
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they took us both up and cast us into the sea. My wife awoke
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"startled from her sleep and, forthright becoming an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ifritah,[FN#57] she bore me up and carried me to an island and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disappeared for a short time; but she returned in the morning and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, Here am I, thy faithful slave, who hath made thee due"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,recompense; for I bore thee up in the waters and saved thee from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"death by command of the Almighty. Know--that I am a Jinniyah, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as I saw thee my heart loved thee by will of the Lord, for I am a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,believer in Allah and in His Apostle (whom Heaven bless and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,preserve!). Thereupon I came to thee conditioned as thou sawest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me and thou didst marry me, and see now I have saved thee from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sinking. But I am angered against thy brothers and assuredly I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"must slay them. When I heard her story I was surprised and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thanking her for all she had done, I said, But as to slaying my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brothers this must not be. Then I told her the tale of what had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,come to pass with them from the beginning of our lives to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"end, and on hearing it quoth she, This night will I fly as a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bird over them and will sink their ship and slay them. Quoth I,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah upon thee, do not thus, for the proverb saith, O thou who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"doest good to him that cloth evil, leave the evil doer to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,evil deeds. Moreover they are still my brothers. But she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoined, By Allah, there is no help for it but I slay them. I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"humbled myself before her for their pardon, whereupon she bore me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up and flew away with me till at last she set me down on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,terrace roof of my own house. I opened the doors and took up what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I had hidden in the ground; and after I had saluted the folk I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,opened my shop and bought me merchandise. Now when night came on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I went home, and there I saw these two hounds tied up; and, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they sighted me, they arose and whined and fawned upon me; but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ere I knew what happened my wife said, These two dogs be thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brothers! I answered, And who hath done this thing by them?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she rejoined, I sent a message to my sister and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entreated them on this wise, nor shall these two be released from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their present shape till ten years shall have passed. And now I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have arrived at this place on my way to my wife's sister that she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"may deliver them from this condition, after their having endured"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it for half a score of years. As I was wending onwards I saw this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young man, who acquainted me with what had befallen him, and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,determined not to fare hence until I should see what might occur
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"between thee and him. Such is my tale! Then said the Jinni,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Surely this is a strange story and therefor I give thee the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,third portion of his blood and his crime. Thereupon quoth the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"third Shaykh, the master of the mare mule, to the Jinni, I can"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tell thee a tale more wondrous than these two, so thou grant me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the remainder of his blood and of his offense, and the Jinni"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, So be it! Then the old man began"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Third Shaykh's Story.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O Sultan and head of the Jann, that this mule was my wife."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Now it so happened that I went forth and was absent one whole
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"year; and when I returned from my journey I came to her by night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and saw a black slave lying with her on the carpet bed and they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"were talking, and dallying, and laughing, and kissing and playing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the close buttock game. When she saw me, she rose and came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hurriedly at me with a gugglet[FN#58] of water; and, muttering"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spells over it, she besprinkled me and said, Come forth from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this thy shape into the shape of a dog; and I became on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"instant a dog. She drove me out of the house, and I ran through"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the doorway nor ceased running until I came to a butcher's stall,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where I stopped and began to eat what bones were there. When the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stall owner saw me, he took me and led me into his house, but as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"soon as his daughter had sight of me she veiled her face from me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crying out, Doss thou bring men to me and dost thou come in with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them to me? Her father asked, Where is the man?; and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, This dog is a man whom his wife hath ensorcelled and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"am able to release him. When her father heard her words, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, Allah upon thee, O my daughter, release him. So she took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a gugglet of water and, after uttering words over it, sprinkled"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon me a few drops, saying, Come forth from that form into thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,former form. And I returned to my natural shape. Then I kissed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her hand and said, I wish thou wouldest transform my wife even"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as she bans formed me. Thereupon she gave me some water, saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"As soon as thou see her asleep, sprinkle this liquid upon her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and speak what words thou heardest me utter, so shall she become"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whatsoever thou desirest. I went to my wife and found her fast
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asleep; and, while sprinkling the water upon her, I said, Come"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth from that form into the form of a mare mule. So she became
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on the instant a she mule, and she it is whom thou seest with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thine eyes, O Sultan and head of the Kings of the Jann! Then the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Jinni turned towards her and said, Is this sooth? And she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nodded her head and replied by signs, Indeed, 'tis the truth:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for such is my tale and this is what hath be fallen me. Now when
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the old man had ceased speaking the Jinni shook with pleasure and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gave him the third of the merchant's blood. And Shahrazad
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then quoth Dunyazad, O. my sister, how pleasant is thy tale, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"how tasteful; how sweet and how grateful! She replied, And what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is this compared with that I could tell thee, the night to come,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"if I live and the King spare me?[FN#59] Then thought the King,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah, I will not slay her until I hear the rest of her tale,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for truly it is wondrous. So they rested that night in mutual
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,embrace until the dawn. After this the King went forth to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hall of Estate, and the Wazir and the troops came in and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"court was crowded, and the King gave orders and judged and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"appointed and deposed, bidding and forbidding during the rest of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the day. Then the Divan broke up, and King Shahryar entered his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,palace.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                  When it was the Third Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And the King had had his will of the Wazir's daughter, Dunyazad,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her sister, said to her, Finish for us that tale of thine; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she replied, With joy and goodly gree! It hath reached me, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"auspicious King, that when the third old man told a tale to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Jinni more wondrous than the two preceding, the Jinni marvelled"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with exceeding marvel, and, shaking with delight, cried, Lo! I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have given thee the remainder of the merchant's punishment and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for thy sake have I released him. Thereupon the merchant
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"embraced the old men and thanked them, and these Shaykhs wished"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him joy on being saved and fared forth each one for his own city.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Yet this tale is not more wondrous than the fisherman's story.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Asked the King, What is the fisherman's story? And she answered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,by relating the tale of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,                  THE FISHERMAN AND THE JINNI.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was a Fisher"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man well stricken in years who had a wife and three children, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,withal was of poor condition. Now it was his custom to cast his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"net every day four times, and no more. On a day he went forth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"about noontide to the sea shore, where he laid down his basket;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, tucking up his shirt and plunging into the water, made a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cast with his net and waited till it settled to the bottom. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he gathered the cords together and haled away at it, but found it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"weighty; and however much he drew it landwards, he could not pull"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it up; so he carried the ends ashore and drove a stake into the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ground and made the net fast to it. Then he stripped and dived
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"into the water all about the net, and left not off working hard"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"until he had brought it up. He rejoiced thereat and, donning his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clothes, went to the net, when he found in it a dead jackass"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which had torn the meshes. Now when he saw it, he exclaimed in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his grief, There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah the Glorious, the Great! Then quoth he, This is a strange"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,manner of daily bread; and he began re citing in extempore
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,verse:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,O toiler through the glooms of night in peril and in pain * Thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     toiling stint for daily bread comes not by might and main!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Seest thou not the fisher seek afloat upon the sea * His bread,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     while glimmer stars of night as set in tangled skein.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Anon he plungeth in despite the buffet of the waves * The while
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     to sight the bellying net his eager glances strain;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Till joying at the night's success, a fish he bringeth home *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Whose gullet by the hook of Fate was caught and cut in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     twain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When buys that fish of him a man who spent the hours of night *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Reckless of cold and wet and gloom in ease and comfort fain,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Laud to the Lord who gives to this, to that denies his wishes *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     And dooms one toil and catch the prey and other eat the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fishes.[FN#60]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then quoth he, Up and to it; I am sure of His beneficence,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Inshallah! So he continued:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When thou art seized of Evil Fate, assume * The noble soul's long"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     suffering: 'tis thy best:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Complain not to the creature; this be plaint * From one most
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Ruthful to the ruthlessest.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Fisherman, when he had looked at the dead ass, got it free of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the toils and wrung out and spread his net; then he plunged into
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the sea, saying, In Allah's name! and made a cast and pulled at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it, but it grew heavy and settled down more firmly than the first"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"time. Now he thought that there were fish in it, and he made it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fast, and doffing his clothes went into the water, and dived and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,haled until he drew it up upon dry land. Then found he in it a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,large earthen pitcher which was full of sand and mud; and seeing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this he was greatly troubled and began repeating these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,verses[FN#61]:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Forbear, O troubles of the world, * And pardon an ye nill"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     forbear:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I went to seek my daily bread * I find that breadless I must
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fare:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,For neither handcraft brings me aught * Nor Fate allots to me a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     share:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,How many fools the Pleiads reach * While darkness whelms the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     wise and ware.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So he prayed pardon of Allah and, throwing away the jar, wrung"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his net and cleansed it and returned to the sea the third time to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cast his net and waited till it had sunk. Then he pulled at it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and found therein potsherds and broken glass; whereupon he began
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to speak these verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,He is to thee that daily bread thou canst nor loose nor bind *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Nor pen nor writ avail thee aught thy daily bread to find:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,For joy and daily bread are what Fate deigneth to allow; * This
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     soil is sad and sterile ground, while that makes glad the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     hind.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The shafts of Time and Life bear down full many a man of worth *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     While bearing up to high degree wights of ignoble mind.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So come thou, Death! for verily life is not worth a straw * When"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,      low the falcon falls withal the mallard wings the wind:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,No wonder 'tis thou seest how the great of soul and mind * Are
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     poor, and many a loser carle to height of luck designed."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,This bird shall overfly the world from east to furthest west *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     And that shall win her every wish though ne'er she leave the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     nest.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then raising his eyes heavenwards he said, O my God![FN#62]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,verily Thou wottest that I cast not my net each day save four
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,times[FN#63]; the third is done and as yet Thou hast vouchsafed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me nothing. So this time, O my God, deign give me my daily"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bread. Then, having called on Allah's name,[FN#64] he again"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,threw his net and waited its sinking and settling; whereupon he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,haled at it but could not draw it in for that it was entangled at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the bottom. He cried out in his vexation There is no Majesty and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there is no Might save in Allah! and he began reciting:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy," Fie on this wretched world, an so it be * I must be whelmed by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,      grief and misery:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy, Tho' gladsome be man's lot when dawns the morn * He drains the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,      cup of woe ere eve he see:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy, Yet was I one of whom the world when asked * Whose lot is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,      happiest? oft would say 'Tis he!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thereupon he stripped and, diving down to the net, busied him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,self with it till it came to land. Then he opened the meshes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"found therein a cucumber shaped jar of yellow copper,[FN#65]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"evidently full of something, whose mouth was made fast with a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leaden cap, stamped with the seal ring of our Lord Sulayman son"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of David (Allah accept the twain!). Seeing this the Fisherman
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoiced and said, If I sell it in the brass bazar 'tis worth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ten golden diners. He shook it and finding it heavy continued,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Would to Heaven I knew what is herein. But I must and will open
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it and look to its contents and store it in my bag and sell it in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the brass market. And taking out a knife he worked at the lead
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till he had loosened it from the jar; then he laid the cup on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ground and shook the vase to pour out whatever might be inside.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,He found nothing in it; whereat he marvelled with an exceeding
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,marvel. But presently there came forth from the jar a smoke which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,spired heavenwards into aether (whereat he again marvelled with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mighty marvel), and which trailed along earth's surface till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"presently, having reached its full height, the thick vapour"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"condensed, and became an Ifrit, huge of bulk, whose crest touched"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the clouds while his feet were on the ground. His head was as a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dome, his hands like pitchforks, his legs long as masts and his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mouth big as a cave; his teeth were like large stones, his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nostrils ewers, his eyes two lamps and his look was fierce and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lowering. Now when the Fisherman saw the Ifrit his side muscles
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quivered, his teeth chattered, his spittle dried up and he became"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blind about what to do. Upon this the Ifrit looked at him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried, There is no god but the God, and Sulayman is the prophet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of God; presently adding, O Apostle of Allah, slay me not;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,never again will I gainsay thee in word nor sin against thee in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deed.[FN#66] Quoth the Fisherman, O Marid,[FN#67] diddest thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"say, Sulayman the Apostle of Allah; and Sulayman is dead some"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou sand and eight hundred years ago,[FN#68] and we are now in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the last days of the world! What is thy story, and what is thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"account of thyself, and what is the cause of thy entering into"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this cucur bit? Now when the Evil Spirit heard the words of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Fisher man, quoth he; There is no god but the God: be of good"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cheer, O Fisherman! Quoth the Fisherman, Why biddest thou me to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be of good cheer? and he replied, Because of thy having to die"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"an ill death in this very hour. Said the Fisherman, Thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,deservest for thy good tidings the withdrawal of Heaven's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"protection, O thou distant one![FN#69] Wherefore shouldest thou kill"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me and what thing have I done to deserve death, I who freed thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from the jar, and saved thee from the depths of the sea, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brought thee up on the dry land? Replied the Ifrit, Ask of me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"only what mode of death thou wilt die, and by what manner of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slaughter shall I slay thee. Rejoined the Fisherman, What is my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crime and wherefore such retribution? Quoth the Ifrit, Hear my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"story, O Fisherman! and he answered, Say on, and be brief in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy saying, for of very sooth my life breath is in my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nostrils.[FN#70] Thereupon quoth the Jinni, Know, that I am one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"among the heretical Jann and I sinned against Sulayman, David son"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,(on the twain be peace!) I together with the famous Sakhr al
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Jinni;[FN#71] whereupon the Prophet sent his minister, Asaf son"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of Barkhiya, to seize me; and this Wazir brought me against my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will and led me in bonds to him (I being downcast despite my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nose) and he placed me standing before him like a suppliant. When
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sulayman saw me, he took refuge with Allah and bade me embrace"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the True Faith and obey his behests; but I refused, so sending"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for this cucurbit[FN#72] he shut me up therein, and stopped it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"over with lead whereon he impressed the Most High Name, and gave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his orders to the Jann who carried me off, and cast me into the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"midmost of the ocean. There I abode an hundred years, during"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which I said in my heart, Whoso shall release me, him will I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"enrich for ever and ever. But the full century went by and, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"no one set me free, I entered upon the second five score saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Whoso shall release me, for him I will open the hoards of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,earth. Still no one set me free and thus four hundred years
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"passed away. Then quoth I, Whoso shall release me, for him will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I fulfil three wishes. Yet no one set me free. Thereupon I waxed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wroth with exceeding wrath and said to myself, Whoso shall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"release me from this time forth, him will I slay and I will give"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him choice of what death he will die; and now, as thou hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"released me, I give thee full choice of deaths. The Fisherman,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hearing the words of the Ifrit, said, O Allah! the wonder of it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that I have not come to free thee save in these days! adding,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Spare my life, so Allah spare thine; and slay me not, lest Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"set one to slay thee. Replied the Contumacious One, There is no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,help for it; die thou must; so ask me by way of boon what manner
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of death thou wilt die. Albeit thus certified the Fisherman
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again addressed the Ifrit saying, Forgive me this my death as a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"generous reward for having freed thee; and the Ifrit, Surely I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would not slay thee save on account of that same release. O
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Chief of the Ifrits, said the Fisherman, I do thee good and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou requitest me with evil! in very sooth the old saw lieth not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when it saith:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"We wrought them weal, they met our weal with ill; * Such, by my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     life! is every bad man's labour:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,To him who benefits unworthy wights * Shall hap what inapt to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Ummi Amir's neighbor.[FN#73]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now when the Ifrit heard these words he answered, No more of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this talk, needs must I kill thee. Upon this the Fisherman said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to himself, This is a Jinni; and I am a man to whom Allah hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"given a passably cunning wit, so I will now cast about to com"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pass his destruction by my contrivance and by mine intelligence;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,even as he took counsel only of his malice and his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"frowardness.[FN#74] He began by asking the Ifrit, Hast thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"indeed resolved to kill me? and, receiving for all answer, Even"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so, he cried, Now in the Most Great Name, graven on the seal"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ring of Sulayman the Son of David (peace be with the holy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"twain!), an I question thee on a certain matter wilt thou give me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a true answer? The Ifrit replied Yea; but, hearing mention of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Most Great Name, his wits were troubled and he said with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"trembling, Ask and be brief. Quoth the Fisherman, How didst"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou fit into this bottle which would not hold thy hand; no, nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"even thy foot, and how came it to be large enough to contain the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whole of thee? Replied the Ifrit, What! cost not believe that I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was all there? and the Fisherman rejoined, Nay! I will never"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,believe it until I see thee inside with my own eyes. And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                 When it was the Fourth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Her sister said to her, Please finish us this tale, an thou be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not sleepy! so she resumed:--It hath reached me, O auspicious"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King, that when the Fisherman said to the Ifrit, I will never"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and nowise believe thee until I see thee inside it with mine own
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eyes; the Evil Spirit on the instant shook[FN#75] and became a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"vapour, which condensed, and entered the jar little and little,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till all was well inside when lo! the Fisherman in hot haste took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the leaden cap with the seal and stoppered therewith the mouth of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the jar and called out to the Ifrit, saying, Ask me by way of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"boon what death thou wilt die! By Allah, I will throw thee into"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the sea[FN#76] be fore us and here will I build me a lodge; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whoso cometh hither I will warn him against fishing and will
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,say:--In these waters abideth an Ifrit who giveth as a last
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,favour a choice of deaths and fashion of slaughter to the man who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saveth him! Now when the Ifrit heard this from the Fisherman and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw him self in limbo, he was minded to escape, but this was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,prevented by Solomon's seal; so he knew that the Fisherman had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cozened and outwitted him, and he waxed lowly and submissive and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"began humbly to say, I did but jest with thee. But the other an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"swered, Thou liest, O vilest of the Ifrits, and meanest and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,filthiest! and he set off with the bottle for the sea side; the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ifrit calling out Nay! Nay! and he calling out Aye! Aye !
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,There upon the Evil Spirit softened his voice and smoothed his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"speech and abased himself, saying, What wouldest thou do with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, O Fisherman? I will throw thee back into the sea, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,answered; where thou hast been housed and homed for a thousand
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and eight hundred years; and now I will leave thee therein till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Judgment day: did I not say to thee:--Spare me and Allah shall
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,spare thee; and slay me not lest Allah slay thee? yet thou spurn
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,east my supplication and hadst no intention save to deal un
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"graciously by me, and Allah hath now thrown thee into my hands"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I am cunninger than thou. Quoth the Ifrit, Open for me and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I may bring thee weal. Quoth the Fisherman, Thou liest, thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,accursed! my case with thee is that of the Wazir of King Yunan
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with the sage Duban.[FN#77] And who was the Wazir of King Yunan
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and who was the sage Duban; and what was the story about them?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth the Ifrit, whereupon the Fisherman began to tell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Tale of the Wazir and the Sage Duban.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O thou Ifrit, that in days of yore and in ages long gone"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before, a King called Yunan reigned over the city of Fars of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"land of the Roum.[FN#78] He was a powerful ruler and a wealthy,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who had armies and guards and allies of all nations of men; but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his body was afflicted with a leprosy which leaches and men of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,science failed to heal. He drank potions and he swallowed pow
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ders and he used unguents, but naught did him good and none among"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the host of physicians availed to procure him a cure. At last
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there came to his city a mighty healer of men and one well
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stricken in years, the sage Duban highs. This man was a reader of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"books, Greek, Persian, Roman, Arabian, and Syrian; and he was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"skilled in astronomy and in leechcraft, the theorick as well as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the practick; he was experienced in all that healeth and that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hurteth the body; conversant with the virtues of every plant,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grass and herb, and their benefit and bane; and he understood"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,philosophy and had compassed the whole range of medical science
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and other branches of the knowledge tree. Now this physician
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"passed but few days in the city, ere he heard of the King's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,malady and all his bodily sufferings through the leprosy with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which Allah had smitten him; and how all the doctors and wise men
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had failed to heal him. Upon this he sat up through the night in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deep thought and, when broke the dawn and appeared the morn and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"light was again born, and the Sun greeted the Good whose beauties"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the world adorn,[FN#79] he donned his handsomest dress and going"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in to King Yunan, he kissed the ground before him: then he prayed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for the endurance of his honour and prosperity in fairest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"language and made himself known saying, O King, tidings have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,reached I me of what befel thee through that which is in thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,person; and how the host of physicians have proved themselves
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unavailing to abate it; and lo! I can cure thee, O King; and yet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will I not make thee drink of draught or anoint thee with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ointment. Now when King Yunan heard his words he said in huge
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"surprise, How wilt thou do this? By Allah, if thou make me whole"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I will enrich thee even to thy son's son and I will give thee
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sumptuous gifts; and whatso thou wishest shall be thine and thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shalt be to me a cup companion[FN#80] and a friend. The King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,then robed him with a dress of honour and entreated him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"graciously and asked him, Canst thou indeed cure me of this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"complaint without drug and unguent? and he answered, Yes! I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will heal I thee without the pains and penalties of medicine.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The King marvelled with exceeding marvel and said, O physician,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when shall be this whereof thou speakest, and in how many days"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shall it take place? Haste thee, O my son! He replied,I hear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I obey; the cure shall begin tomorrow. So saying he went
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forth from the presence, and hired himself a house in the city"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for the better storage of his books and scrolls, his medicines"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and his aromatic roots. Then he set to work at choosing the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fittest drugs and simples and he fashioned a bat hollow within,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and furnished with a handle without, for which he made a ball;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the two being prepared with consummate art. On the next day when
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"both were ready for use and wanted nothing more, he went up to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King; and, kissing the ground between his hands bade him ride"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth on the parade ground[FN#81] there to play at pall and mall.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"He was accompanied by his suite, Emirs and Chamberlains, Wazirs"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and Lords of the realm and, ere he was seated, the sage Duban"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came up to him, and handing him the bat said, Take this mall and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,grip it as I do; so! and now push for the plain and leaning well
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,over thy horse drive the ball with all thy might until thy palm
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be moist and thy body perspire: then the medicine will penetrate
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,through thy palm and will permeate thy person. When thou hast
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"done with playing and thou feelest the effects of the medicine,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"return to thy palace, and make the Ghusl ablation[FN#82] in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hammam bath, and lay thee down to sleep; so shalt thou be come"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whole; and now peace be with thee! Thereupon King Yunan took the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bat from the Sage and grasped it firmly; then, mounting steed, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drove the ball before him and gallopped after it till he reached
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it, when he struck it with all his might, his palm gripping the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bat handle the while; and he ceased not malling the ball till his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hand waxed moist and his skin, perspiring, imbibed the medicine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from the wood. Then the sage Duban knew that the drugs had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,penetrated his person and bade him return to the palace and enter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Hammam without stay or delay; so King Yunan forthright
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned and ordered them to clear for him the bath. They did so,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the carpet spreaders making all haste, and the slaves all hurry"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and got ready a change of raiment for the King. He entered the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bath and made the total ablution long and thoroughly; then donned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his clothes within the Hammam and rode therefrom to his palace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where he lay him down and slept. Such was the case with King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Yunan, but as regards the sage Duban, he returned home and slept"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,as usual and when morning dawned he repaired to the palace and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"craved audience. The King ordered him to be admitted; then,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"having kissed the ground between his hands, in allusion to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King he recited these couplets with solemn intonation:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Happy is Eloquence when thou art named her sire * But mourns
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     she whenas other man the title claimed.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O Lord of fairest presence, whose illuming rays * Clear off the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     fogs of doubt aye veiling deeds high famed,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ne'er cease thy face to shine like Dawn and rise of Morn * And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     never show Time's face with heat of ire inflamed!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thy grace hath favoured us with gifts that worked such wise * As
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     rain clouds raining on the hills by words enframed:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Freely thou lavishedst thy wealth to rise on high * Till won from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Time the heights whereat thy grandeur aimed.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now when the Sage ceased reciting, the King rose quickly to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feet and fell on his neck; then, seating him by his side he bade"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dress him in a sumptuous dress; for it had so happened that when
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the King left the Hammam he looked on his body and saw no trace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of leprosy: the skin was all clean as virgin silver. He joyed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thereat with exceeding joy, his breast broadened[FN#83] with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"delight and he felt thoroughly happy. Presently, when it was full"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,day he entered his audience hall and sat upon the throne of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kingship whereupon his Chamberlains and Grandees flocked to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,presence and with them the Sage Duban. Seeing the leach the King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rose to him in honour and seated him by his side; then the food
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,trays furnished with the daintiest viands were brought and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"physician ate with the King, nor did he cease companying him all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that day. Moreover, at nightfall he gave the physician Duban two"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thousand gold pieces, besides the usual dress of honour and other"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gifts galore, and sent him home on his own steed. After the Sage"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had fared forth King Yunan again expressed his amazement at the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leach's art, saying, This man medicined my body from without nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"anointed me with aught of ointments: by Allah, surely this is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,none other than consummate skill! I am bound to honour such a man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with re wards and distinction, and take him to my companion and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my friend during the remainder of my days. So King Yunan passed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the night in joy and gladness for that his body had been made
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whole and had thrown off so pernicious a malady. On the morrow
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King went forth from his Serraglio and sat upon his throne,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the Lords of Estate stood about him, and the Emirs and Wazirs"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sat as was their wont on his right hand and on his left. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asked for the Sage Duban, who came in and kissed the ground"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before him, when the King rose to greet him and, seating him by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his side, ate with him and wished him long life. Moreover he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"robed him and gave him gifts, and ceased not con versing with him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"until night approached. Then the King ordered him, by way of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"salary, five dresses of honour and a thousand dinars.[FN#84] The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,physician returned to his own house full of gratitude to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King. Now when next morning dawned the King repaired to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"audience hall, and his Lords and Nobles surrounded him and his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Chamberlains and his Ministers, as the white en closeth the black"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the eye.[FN#85] Now the King had a Wazir among his Wazirs,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unsightly to look upon, an ill omened spectacle; sor did,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ungenerous, full of envy and evil will. When this Minister saw"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the King place the physician near him and give him all these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gifts, he jaloused him and planned to do him a harm, as in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying on such subject, Envy lurks in every body; and the say"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ing, Oppression hideth in every heart: power revealeth it and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,weakness concealeth it. Then the Minister came before the King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, kissing the ground between his hands, said, O King of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"age and of all time, thou in whose benefits I have grown to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"manhood, I have weighty advice to offer thee, and if I withhold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it I were a son of adultery and no true born man; wherefore an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou order me to disclose it I will so do forthwith. Quoth the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King (and he was troubled at the words of the Minister), And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what is this counsel of thine? Quoth he, O glorious monarch,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the wise of old have said:--Whoso regardeth not the end, hath not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Fortune to friend; and indeed I have lately seen the King on far
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"other than the right way; for he lavisheth largesse on his enemy,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on one whose object is the decline and fall of his king ship: to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this man he hath shown favour, honouring him with over honour and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,making of him an intimate. Wherefore I fear for the King's life.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The King, who was much troubled and changed colour, asked, Whom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cost thou suspect and anent whom doest thou hint? and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Minister answered, O King, an thou be asleep, wake up! I point"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the physician Duban. Rejoined the King, Fie upon thee! This"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is a true friend who is favoured by me above all men, because he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cured me with some thing which I held in my hand, and he healed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my leprosy which had baffled all physicians; indeed he is one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whose like may not be found in these days--no, not in the whole"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,world from furthest east to utmost west! And it is of such a man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou sayest such hard sayings. Now from this day forward I allot
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him a settled solde and allowances, every month a thousand gold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pieces; and, were I to share with him my realm 'twere but a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,little matter. Perforce I must suspect that thou speakest on this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wise from mere envy and jealousy as they relate of the King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sindibad.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying her permitted say. Then quoth Dunyazad, O my sister, how"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pleasant is thy tale, and how tasteful, how sweet, and how"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grateful! She replied, And where is this compared with what I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,could tell thee on the coming night if the King deign spare my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"life? Then said the King in himself, By Allah, I will not slay"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her until I hear the rest of her tale, for truly it is wondrous."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So they rested that night in mutual embrace until the dawn. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King went forth to his Hall of Rule, and the Wazir and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"troops came in, and the audience chamber was thronged and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King gave orders and judged and appointed and deposed and bade
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and forbade during the rest of that day till the Court broke up,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and King Shahryar returned to his palace.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                  When It Was The Fifth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Her sister said, Do you finish for us thy story if thou be not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sleepy, and she resumed:--It hath reached me, O auspicious King"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and mighty Monarch, that King Yunan said to his Minister, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir, thou art one whom the evil spirit of envy hath possessed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"because of this physician, and thou plottest for my putting him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to death, after which I should repent me full sorely, even as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"repented King Sindibad for killing his falcon. Quoth the Wazir,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Pardon me, O King of the age, how was that? So the King began"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the story of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King Sindibad and his Falcon.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,It is said (but Allah is All knowing![FN#86]) that there was a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King of the Kings of Fars, who was fond of pleasuring and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"diversion, especially coursing end hunting. He had reared a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"falcon which he carried all night on his fist, and whenever he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went a chasing he took with him this bird; and he bade make for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her a golden cuplet hung around her neck to give her drink
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"therefrom. One day as the King was sitting quietly in his palace,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"behold, the high falcaner of the household suddenly addressed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, O King of the age, this is indeed a day fit for birding."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The King gave orders accordingly and set out taking the hawk on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fist; and they fared merrily forwards till they made a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wady[FN#87] where they planted a circle of nets for the chase;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when lo! a gazelle came within the toils and the King cried,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Whoso alloweth yon gazelle to spring over his head and loseth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, that man will I surely slay. They narrowed the nets about"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the gazelle when she drew near the King's station; and, planting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"herself on her hind quarter, crossed her forehand over her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"breast, as if about to kiss the earth before the King. He bowed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his brow low in acknowledgment to the beast; when she bounded
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,high over his head and took the way of the waste. Thereupon the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King turned towards his troops and seeing them winking and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pointing at him, he asked, O Wazir, what are my men saying? and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Minister answered, They say thou didst proclaim that whoso"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"alloweth the gazelle to spring over his head, that man shall be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"put to death. Quoth the King, Now, by the life of my head! I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will follow her up till I bring her back. So he set off
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gallopping on the gazelle's trail and gave not over tracking till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he reached the foot hills of a mountain chain where the quarry
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made for a cave. Then the King cast off at it the falcon which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"presently caught it up and, swooping down, drove her talons into"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"its eyes, bewildering and blinding it;[FN#88] and the King drew"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his mace and struck a blow which rolled the game over. He then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dismounted; and, after cutting the antelope's throat and flaying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the body, hung it to the pommel of his saddle. Now the time was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that of the siesta[FN#89] and the wold was parched and dry, nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was any water to be found anywhere; and the King thirsted and his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,horse also; so he went about searching till he saw a tree
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dropping water, as it were melted butter, from its boughs."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thereupon the King who wore gauntlets of skin to guard him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"against poisons took the cup from the hawk's neck, and filling it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with the water set it before the bird, and lo! the falcon struck"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it with her pounces and upset the liquid. The King filled it a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"second time with the dripping drops, thinking his hawk was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thirsty; but the bird again struck at the cup with her talons and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,overturned it. Then the King waxed wroth with the hawk and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,filling the cup a third time offered it to his horse: but the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hawk upset it with a flirt of wings. Quoth the King, Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"confound thee, thou unluckiest of flying things! thou keepest me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from drinking, and thou deprivest thyself also, and the horse."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So he struck the falcon with his sword and cut off her wing; but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the bird raised her head and said by signs, Look at that which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hangeth on the tree! The King lifted up his eyes accordingly and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"caught sight of a brood of vipers, whose poison drops he mistook"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for water; thereupon he repented him of having struck off his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"falcon's wing, and mounting horse, fared on with the dead"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gazelle, till he arrived at the camp, his starting place. He"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"threw the quarry to the cook saying, Take and broil it, and sat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"down on his chair, the falcon being still on his fist when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,suddenly the bird gasped and died; whereupon the King cried out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in sorrow and remorse for having slain that falcon which had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saved his life. Now this is what occurred in the case of King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Sindibad; and I am assured that were I to do as thou desirest I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,should repent even as the man who killed his parrot. Quoth the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir, And how was that? And the King began to tell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Tale of the Husband and the Parrot.[FN#90]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"A certain man and a merchant to boot had married a fair wife, a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"woman of perfect beauty and grace, symmetry and loveliness, of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whom he was mad-jealous, and who contrived successfully to keep"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him from travel. At last an occasion compelling him to leave her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he went to the bird market and bought him for one hundred gold
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pieces a she parrot which he set in his house to act as duenna,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,expecting her to acquaint him on his return with what had passed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,during the whole time of his absence; for the bird was kenning
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and cunning and never forgot what she had seen and heard. Now his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fair wife had fallen in love with a young Turk, [FN#91] who used"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to visit her, and she feasted him by day and lay with him by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,night. When the man had made his journey and won his wish he came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"home; and, at once causing the Parrot be brought to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,questioned her concerning the conduct of his consort whilst he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was in foreign parts. Quoth she, Thy wife hath a man friend who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,passed every night with her during thine absence. Thereupon the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,husband went to his wife in a violent rage and bashed her with a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bashing severe enough to satisfy any body. The woman, suspecting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that one of the slave girls had been tattling to the master,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"called them together and questioned them upon their oaths, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all swore that they had kept the secret, but that the Parrot had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not, adding, And we heard her with our own ears. Upon this the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,woman bade one of the girls to set a hand mill under the cage and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,grind therewith and a second to sprinkle water through the cage
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"roof and a third to run about, right and left, dashing a mirror"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of bright steel through the livelong night. Next morning when the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,husband returned home after being entertained by one of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"friends, he bade bring the Parrot before him and asked what had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"taken place whilst he was away. Pardon me, O my master, quoth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the bird, I could neither hear nor see aught by reason of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,exceeding murk and the thunder and lightning which lasted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,throughout the night. As it happened to be the summer tide the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"master was astounded and cried, But we are now in mid"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tammuz,[FN#92] and this is not the time for rains and storms."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ay, by Allah, rejoined the bird, I saw with these eyes what my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tongue hath told thee. Upon this the man, not knowing the case"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nor smoking the plot, waxed exceeding wroth; and, holding that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his wife had been wrongously accused, put forth his hand and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pulling the Parrot from her cage dashed her upon the ground with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,such force that he killed her on the spot. Some days after wards
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one of his slave girls confessed to him the whole truth,[FN#93]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yet would he not believe it till he saw the young Turk, his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wife's lover, coming out of her chamber, when he bared his blade"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#94] and slew him by a blow on the back of the neck; and he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"did the same by the adulteress; and thus the twain, laden with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mortal sin, went straightways to Eternal Fire. Then the merchant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,knew that the Parrot had told him the truth anent all she had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seen and he mourned grievously for her loss, when mourning"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"availed him not. The Minister, hearing the words of King Yu nan,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoined, 'O Monarch, high in dignity, and what harm have I done"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, or what evil have I seen from him that I should compass his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"death? I would not do this thing, save to serve thee, and soon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shalt thou sight that it is right; and if thou accept my advice
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou shalt be saved, otherwise thou shalt be destroyed even as a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,certain Wazir who acted treacherously by the young Prince. Asked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King, How was that? and the Minister thus began"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Tale of the Prince and the Ogress.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"A certain King, who had a son over much given to hunting and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"coursing, ordered one of his Wazirs to be in attendance upon him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whithersoever he might wend. One day the youth set out for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"chase accompanied by his father's Minister; and, as they jogged"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on together, a big wild beast came in sight. Cried the Wazir to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King's son, Up and at yon noble quarry! So the Prince"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,followed it until he was lost to every eye and the chase got away
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from him in the waste; whereby he was confused and he knew not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which way to turn, when lo! a damsel appeared ahead and she was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in tears. The King's son asked, Who art thou? and she answered,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I am daughter to a King among the Kings of Hind, and I was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,travelling with a caravan in the desert when drowsiness overcame
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, and I fell from my beast unwittingly whereby I am cut off"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from my people and sore bewildered. The Prince, hearing these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"words, pitied her case and, mounting her on his horse's crupper,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"travelled until he passed by an old ruin [FN#95], when the damsel"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to him, O my master, I wish to obey a call of nature: he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,therefore set her down at the ruin where she delayed so long that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the King's son thought that she was only wasting time; so he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"followed her without her knowledge and behold, she was a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ghulah,[FN#96] a wicked Ogress, who was saying to her brood, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my children, this day I bring you a fine fat youth, [FN#97] for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dinner; whereto they answered, Bring him quick to us, O our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mother, that we may browse upon him our bellies full. The Prince"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hearing their talk, made sure of death and his side muscles"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quivered in fear for his life, so he turned away and was about to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fly. The Ghulah came out and seeing him in sore affright (for he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was trembling in every limb? cried, Wherefore art thou afraid?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he replied, I have hit upon an enemy whom I greatly fear."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Asked the Ghulah, Diddest thou not say: - I am a King's son?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he answered, Even so. Then quoth she, Why cost not give"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shine enemy something of money and so satisfy him? Quoth he, He"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will not be satisfied with my purse but only with my life, and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mortally fear him and am a man under oppression. She replied,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If thou be so distressed, as thou deemest, ask aid against him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from Allah, who will surely protect thee from his ill doing and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from the evil whereof thou art afraid. Then the Prince raised
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his eyes heavenwards and cried, O Thou who answerest the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,necessitous when he calleth upon Thee and dispellest his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,distress; O my God ! grant me victory over my foe and turn him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from me, for Thou over all things art Almighty. The Ghulah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hearing his prayer, turned away from him, and the Prince returned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to his father, and told him the tale of the Wazir; whereupon the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King summoned the Minister to his presence and then and there
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slew him. Thou likewise, O King, if thou continue to trust this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leach, shalt be made to die the worst of deaths. He verily thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"madest much of and whom thou entreatedest as an intimate, will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,work thy destruction. Seest thou not how he healed the disease
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from outside thy body by something grasped in thy hand? Be not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,assured that he will not destroy thee by something held in like
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"manner! Replied King Yunan, Thou hast spoken sooth, O Wazir, it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,may well be as thou hintest O my well advising Minister; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,belike this Sage hath come as a spy searching to put me to death;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for assuredly if he cured me by a something held in my hand, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,can kill me by a something given me to smell. Then asked King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Yunan, O Minister, what must be done with him? and the Wazir"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, Send after him this very instant and summon him to thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,presence; and when he shall come strike him across the neck; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thus shalt thou rid thyself of him and his wickedness, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,deceive him ere he can I deceive thee. 'Thou hast again spoken
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sooth, O Wazir, said the King and sent one to call the Sage who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came in joyful mood for he knew not what had appointed for him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Compassionate; as a certain poet saith by way of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,illustration:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O Thou who fearest Fate, confiding fare * Trust all to Him who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     built the world and wait:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"What Fate saith Be perforce must be, my lord! * And safe art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thou from th undecreed of Fate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,As Duban the physician entered he addressed the King in these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,An fail I of my thanks to thee nor thank thee day by day * For
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     whom com posed I prose and verse, for whom my say and lay?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thou lavishedst thy generous gifts ere they were craved by me *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Thou lavishedst thy boons unsought sans pretext or delay:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"How shall I stint my praise of thee, how shall I cease to laud *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     The grace of thee in secresy and patentest display?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nay; I will thank thy benefits, for aye thy favours lie * Light"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     on my thought and tongue, though heavy on my back they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     weigh.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And he said further on the same theme:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Turn thee from grief nor care a jot! * Commit thy needs to Fate
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and Lot!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Enjoy the Present passing well * And let the Past be clean forgot
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,For whatso haply seemeth worse * Shall work thy weal as Allah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     wot
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah shall do whate'er He wills * And in His will oppose Him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     not.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And further still.--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,To th' All wise Subtle One trust worldly things * Rest thee from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     all whereto the worldling clings:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Learn wisely well naught cometh by thy will * But e'en as willeth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Allah, King of Kings."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And lastly.--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Gladsome and gay forget thine every grief * Full often grief the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     wisest hearts outwore:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thought is but folly in the feeble slave * Shun it and so be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     saved evermore.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Said the King for sole return, Knowest thou why I have summoned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee? and the Sage replied, Allah Most Highest alone kenneth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hidden things! But the King rejoined, I summoned thee only to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,take thy life and utterly to destroy thee. Duban the Wise
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wondered at this strange address with exceeding wonder and asked,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O King, and wherefore wouldest thou slay me, and what ill have I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"done thee? and the King answered, Men tell me thou art a spy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sent hither with intent to slay me; and lo! I will kill thee ere
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I be killed by thee; then he called to his Sworder, and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Strike me off the head of this traitor and deliver us from his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"evil practices. Quoth the Sage, Spare me and Allah will spare"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee; slay me not or Allah shall slay thee. And he repeated to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him these very words, even as I to thee, O Ifrit, and yet thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wouldst not let me go, being bent upon my death. King Yunan only"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoined, I shall not be safe without slaying thee; for, as thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"healedst me by something held in hand, so am I not secure against"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy killing me by something given me to smell or otherwise. Said
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the physician, This then, O King, is thy requital and reward;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou returnest only evil for good. The King replied, There is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,no help for it; die thou must and without delay. Now when the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,physician was certified that the King would slay him without
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waiting, he wept and regretted the good he had done to other than"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the good. As one hath said on this subject:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Of wit and wisdom is Maymunah[FN#98] bare * Whose sire in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     wisdom all the wits outstrippeth:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Man may not tread on mud or dust or clay * Save by good sense,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     else trippeth he and slippeth.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hereupon the Sworder stepped forward and bound the Sage Duban's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eyes and bared his blade, saying to the King, By thy leave;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"while the physician wept and cried, Spare me and Allah will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spare thee, and slay me not or Allah shall slay thee, and began"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,repeating:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I was kind and 'scaped not, they were cruel and escaped; * And my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     kindness only led me to Ruination Hall,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If I live I'll ne'er be kind; if I die, then all be damned * Who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     follow me, and curses their kindliness befal."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Is this, continued Duban, the return I meet from thee? Thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"givest me, meseems, but crocodile boon. Quoth the King,What is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the tale of the crocodile?, and quoth the physician, Impossible"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for me to tell it in this my state; Allah upon thee, spare me, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou hopest Allah shall spare thee. And he wept with ex ceeding
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"weeping. Then one of the King's favourites stood up and said, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King! grant me the blood of this physician; we have never seen
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him sin against thee, or doing aught save healing thee from a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disease which baffled every leach and man of science. Said the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King, Ye wot not the cause of my putting to death this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"physician, and this it is. If I spare him, I doom myself to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,certain death; for one who healed me of such a malady by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"something held in my hand, surely can slay me by something held"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to my nose; and I fear lest he kill me for a price, since haply"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he is some spy whose sole purpose in coming hither was to compass
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my destruction. So there is no help for it; die he must, and then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"only shall I be sure of my own life. Again cried Duban, Spare"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me and Allah shall spare thee; and slay me not or Allah shall
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slay thee. But it was in vain. Now when the physician, O Ifrit,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"knew for certain that the King would kill him, he said, O King,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"if there be no help but I must die, grant me some little delay"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that I may go down to my house and release myself from mine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,obligations and direct my folk and my neighbours where to bury me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and distribute my books of medicine. Amongst these I have one,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the rarest of rarities, which I would present to thee as an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,offering: keep it as a treasure in thy treasury. And what is in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the book? asked the King and the Sage answered, Things beyond"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"compt; and the least of secrets is that if, directly after thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hast cut off my head, thou open three leaves and read three lines"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the page to thy left hand, my head shall speak and answer"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,every question thou deignest ask of it. The King wondered with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding wonder and shaking[FN#99] with delight at the novelty,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, O physician, cost thou really tell me that when I cut off"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy head it will speak to me? He replied, Yes, O King! Quoth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King, This is indeed a strange matter! and forthwith sent"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him closely guarded to his house, and Duban then and there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,settled all his obligations. Next day he went up to the King's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"audience hall, where Emirs and Wazirs, Chamberlains and Nabobs,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Grandees and Lords of Estate were gathered together, making the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,presence chamber gay as a garden of flower beds. And lo! the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"physician came up and stood before the King, bearing a worn old"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"volume and a little etui of metal full of powder, like that used"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for the eyes.[FN#100] Then he sat down and said, Give me a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tray. So they brought him one and he poured the powder upon it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and levelled it and lastly spake as follows: O King, take this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,book but do not open it till my head falls; then set it upon this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tray, and bid press it down upon the powder, when forthright the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blood will cease flowing. That is the time to open the book. The
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King thereupon took the book and made a sign to the Sworder, who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arose and struck off the physician's head, and placing it on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"middle of the tray, pressed it down upon the powder. The blood"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stopped flowing, and the Sage Duban unclosed his eyes and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now open the book, O King! The King opened the book, and found"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the leaves stuck together; so he put his finger to his mouth and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"by moistening it, he easily turned over the first leaf, and in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like way the second, and the third, each leaf opening with much"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,trouble; and when he had un stuck six leaves he looked over them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, finding nothing written thereon, said, O physician, there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is no writing here! Duban re plied, Turn over yet more; and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,turned over three others in the same way. Now the book was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"poisoned; and before long the venom penetrated his system, and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell into strong convulsions and he cried out, The poison hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,done its work! Whereupon the Sage Duban's head began to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,improvise:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,There be rulers who have ruled with a foul tyrannic sway *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     But they soon became as though they had never, never been:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Just, they had won justice: they oppressed and were oppress *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     By Fortune, who requited them with ban and bane and teen:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So they faded like the morn, and the tongue of things repeats *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Take this far that, nor vent upon Fortune's ways thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     spleen.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,No sooner had the head ceased speaking than the King rolled over
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dead. Now I would have thee know, O Ifrit, that if King Yunan had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spared the Sage Duban, Allah would have spared him, but he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"refused so to do and decreed to do him dead, wherefore Allah slew"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him; and thou too, O Ifrit, if thou hadst spared me, Allah would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have spared thee. And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ceased saying her permitted say: then quoth Dunyazad, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sister, how pleasant is thy tale, and how tasteful; how sweet,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and how grateful! She replied, And where is this compared with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what I could tell thee this coming night, if I live and the King"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spare me? Said the King in himself, By Allah, I will not slay"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her until I hear the rest of her story, for truly it is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wondrous. They rested that night in mutual embrace until dawn:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,then the King went forth to his Darbar; the Wazirs and troops
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came in and the audience hall was crowded; so the King gave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,orders and judged and appointed and deposed and bade and forbade
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the rest of that day, when the court broke up, and King Shahryar"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered his palace,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                  When it was the Sixth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Her sister, Dunyazad, said to her,Pray finish for us thy story;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she answered, I will if the King give me leave. Say on,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth the King. And she continued:--It hath reached me, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"auspicious King, that when the Fisherman said to the Ifrit, If"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou hadst spared me I would have spared thee, but nothing would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,satisfy thee save my death; so now I will do thee die by jailing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee in this jar and I will hurl thee into this sea. Then the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Marid roared aloud and cried, Allah upon thee, O Fisher man,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"don't! Spare me, and pardon my past doings; and, as I have been"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tyrannous, so be thou generous, for it is said among sayings that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,go current:--O thou who doest good to him who hath done thee
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"evil, suffice for the ill doer his ill deeds, and do not deal"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with me as did Umamah to 'Atikah.[FN#101] Asked the Fisherman,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And what was their case? and the Ifrit answered, This is not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the time for story telling and I in this prison; but set me free
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I will tell thee the tale. Quoth the Fisherman, Leave this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,language: there is no help but that thou be thrown back into the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sea nor is there any way for thy getting out of it for ever and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ever. Vainly I placed myself under thy protection,[FN#102] and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"humbled my self to thee with weeping, while thou soughtest only"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to slay me, who had done thee no injury deserving this at thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hands; nay, so far from injuring thee by any evil act, I worked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee nought but weal in releasing thee from that jail of thine.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Now I knew thee to be an evil doer when thou diddest to me what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou didst, and know, that when I have cast thee back into the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sea, I will warn whomsoever may fish thee up of what hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befallen me with thee, and I will advise him to toss thee back"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,again; so shalt thou abide here under these waters till the End
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of Time shall make an end of thee. But the Ifrit cried aloud,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Set me free; this is a noble occasion for generosity and I make
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"covenant with thee and vow never to do thee hurt and harm; nay, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will help thee to what shall put thee out of want. The Fisherman
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"accepted his promises on both conditions, not to trouble him as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before, but on the contrary to do him service; and, after making"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,firm the plight and swearing him a solemn oath by Allah Most
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Highest he opened the cucurbit. Thereupon the pillar of smoke
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rose up till all of it was fully out; then it thickened and once
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"more became an Ifrit of hideous presence, who forthright ad"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ministered a kick to the bottle and sent it flying into the sea.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Fisherman, seeing how the cucurbit was treated and making"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sure of his own death, piddled in his clothes and said to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself, This promiseth badly; but he fortified his heart, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried, O Ifrit, Allah hath said[FN#103]: - Perform your"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,covenant; for the performance of your covenant shall be inquired
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,into hereafter. Thou hast made a vow to me and hast sworn an oath
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not to play me false lest Allah play thee false, for verily he is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a jealous God who respiteth the sinner, but letteth him not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"escape. I say to thee as said the Sage Duban to King Yunan,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Spare me so Allah may spare thee! The Ifrit burst into laughter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and stalked away, saying to the Fisherman, Follow me; and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,man paced after him at a safe distance (for he was not assured of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,escape) till they had passed round the suburbs of the city.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thence they struck into the uncultivated grounds, and crossing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them descended into a broad wilderness, and lo! in the midst of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it stood a mountain tarn. The Ifrit waded in to the middle and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again cried, Follow me; and when this was done he took his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stand in the centre and bade the man cast his net and catch his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fish. The Fisherman looked into the water and was much astonished
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to see therein vari coloured fishes, white and red, blue and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yellow; however he cast his net and, hauling it in, saw that he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had netted four fishes, one of each colour. Thereat he rejoiced"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"greatly and more when the Ifrit said to him, Carry these to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Sultan and set them in his presence; then he will give thee what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shall make thee a wealthy man; and now accept my excuse, for by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah at this time I wot none other way of benefiting thee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,inasmuch I have lain in this sea eighteen hundred years and have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not seen the face of the world save within this hour. But I would
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not have thee fish here save once a day. The Ifrit then gave him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"God speed, saying, Allah grant we meet again;[FN#104] and struck"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the earth with one foot, whereupon the ground clove asunder and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"swallowed him up. The Fisherman, much marvelling at what had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"happened to him with the Ifrit, took the fish and made for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,city; and as soon as he reached home he filled an earthen bowl
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with water and therein threw the fish which began to struggle and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wriggle about. Then he bore off the bowl upon his head and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,repairing to the King's palace (even as the Ifrit had bidden him)
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,laid the fish before the presence; and the King wondered with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding wonder at the sight, for never in his lifetime had' he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seen fishes like these in quality or in conformation. So he said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Give those fish to the stranger slave girl who now cooketh for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us, meaning the bond maiden whom the King of Roum had sent to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him only three days before, so that he had not yet made trial of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her talents in the dressing of meat. Thereupon the Wazir carried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the fish to the cook and bade her fry them[FN#105] saying, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"damsel, the King sendeth this say to thee:--I have not treasured"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee, O tear o' me! save for stress time of me; approve, then, to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,us this day thy delicate handiwork and thy savoury cooking; for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this dish of fish is a present sent to the Sultan and evidently a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rarity. The Wazir, after he had carefully charged her, returned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the King, who commanded him to give the Fisherman four hundred"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"diners: he gave them accordingly, and the man took them to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bosom and ran off home stumbling and falling and rising again and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deeming the whole thing to be a dream. However, he bought for his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,family all they wanted and lastly he went to his wife in huge joy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and gladness. So far concerning him; but as regards the cookmaid,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she took the fish and cleansed them and set them in the frying
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pan, basting them with oil till one side was dressed. Then she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"turned them over and, behold, the kitchen wall crave asunder, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"therefrom came a young lady, fair of form, oval of face, perfect"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in grace, with eyelids which Kohl lines enchase.[FN#106] Her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dress was a silken head kerchief fringed and tasseled with blue:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a large ring hung from either ear; a pair of bracelets adorned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her wrists; rings with bezels of priceless gems were on her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fingers; and she hent in hand a long rod of rattan cane which she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thrust into the frying pan, saying, O fish! O fish! be ye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,constant to your covenant? When the cookmaiden saw this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,apparition she swooned away. The young lady repeated her words a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"second time and a third time, and at last the fishes raised their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heads from the pan, and saying in articulate speech Yes! Yes!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,began with one voice to recite:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Come back and so will I! Keep faith and so will I! * And if ye
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"      fain forsake, I'll requite till quits we cry!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,After this the young lady upset the frying pan and went forth by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the way she came in and the kitchen wall closed upon her. When
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the cook maiden recovered from her fainting fit, she saw the four"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fishes charred black as charcoal, and crying out, His staff"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brake in his first bout,[FN#107] she again fell swooning to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ground. Whilst she was in this case the Wazir came for the fish
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and looking upon her as insensible she lay, not knowing Sunday"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from Thursday, shoved her with his foot and said, Bring the fish"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for the Sultan! Thereupon recovering from her fainting fit she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wept and in formed him of her case and all that had befallen her.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Wazir marvelled greatly and exclaiming, This is none other"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than a right strange matter!, he sent after the Fisherman and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to him, Thou, O Fisherman, must needs fetch us four fishes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,like those thou broughtest before. Thereupon the man repaired to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the tarn and cast his net; and when he landed it, lo! four fishes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,were therein exactly like the first. These he at once carried to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Wazir, who went in with them to the cook maiden and said, Up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with thee and fry these in my presence, that I may see this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"business. The damsel arose and cleansed the fish, and set them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in the frying pan over the fire; however they remained there but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a little while ere the wall crave asunder and the young lady
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"appeared, clad as before and holding in hand the wand which she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again thrust into the frying pan, saying, O fish! O fish! be ye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"constant to your olden covenant? And behold, the fish lifted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their heads, and repeated Yes! Yes! and recited this couplet:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Come back and so will I! Keep faith and so will I! * But if ye
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     fain forsake, I'll requite till quits we cry!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                 When it was the Seventh Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the fishes spoke, and the young lady upset the frying pan with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her rod, and went forth by the way she came and the wall closed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"up, the Wazir cried out, This is a thing not to be hidden from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King. So he went and told him what had happened, where upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth the King, There is no help for it but that I see this with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mine own eyes. Then he sent for the Fisherman and commended him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to bring four other fish like the first and to take with him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,three men as witnesses. The Fisherman at once brought the fish:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the King, after ordering them to give him four hundred gold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pieces, turned to the Wazir and said, Up and fry me the fishes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"here before me! The Minister, replying To hear is to obey,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bade bring the frying pan, threw therein the cleansed fish and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"set it over the fire; when lo! the wall crave asunder, and out"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,burst a black slave like a huge rock or a remnant of the tribe
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ad[FN#108] bearing in hand a branch of a green tree; and he cried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in loud and terrible tones, O fish! O fish! be ye all constant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to your antique covenant? whereupon the fishes lifted their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heads from the frying pan and said, Yes! Yes ! we be true to our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,vow; and they again recited the couplet:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Come back and so will I! Keep faith and so will I! * But if ye
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     fain forsake, I'll requite till quits we cry!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then the huge blackamoor approached the frying pan and upset it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with the branch and went forth by the way he came in. When he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,vanished from their sight the King inspected the fish; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"finding them all charred black as charcoal, was utterly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bewildered and said to the Wazir, Verily this is a matter"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereanent silence cannot be kept, and as for the fishes,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,assuredly some marvellous adventure connects with them. So he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bade bring the Fisherman and asked him, saying Fie on thee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fellow! whence came these fishes? and he answered, From a tarn"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,between four heights lying behind this mountain which is in sight
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of thy city. Quoth the King, How many days' march? Quoth he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O our lord the Sultan, a walk of half hour. The King wondered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, straight way ordering his men to march and horsemen to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mount, led off the Fisherman who went before as guide, privily"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,damning the Ifrit. They fared on till they had climbed the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mountain and descended unto a great desert which they had never
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seen during all their lives; and the Sultan and his merry men
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marvelled much at the wold set in the midst of four mountains,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the tarn and its fishes of four colours, red and white,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,yellow and blue. The King stood fixed to the spot in wonderment
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and asked his troops and all present, Hath any one among you"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ever seen this piece of water before now? and all made answer,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,O King of the age never did we set eyes upon it during all our
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"days. They also questioned the oldest inhabitants they met, men"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"well stricken in years, but they replied, each and every, A"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lakelet this we never saw in this place. Thereupon quoth the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King, By Allah I will neither return to my capital nor sit upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the throne of my forbears till I learn the truth about this tarn
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the fish therein. He then ordered his men to dismount and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bivouac all around the mountain; which they did; and summoning
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his Wazir, a Minister of much experience, sagacious, of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"penetrating wit and well versed in affairs, said to him, 'Tis in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my mind to do a certain thing whereof I will inform thee; my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heart telleth me to fare forth alone this night and root out the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mystery of this tarn and its fishes. Do thou take thy seat at my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tent door, and say to the Emirs and Wazirs, the Nabobs and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Chamberlains, in fine to all who ask thee:--The Sultan is ill at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ease, and he hath ordered me to refuse all admittance;[FN#109]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and be careful thou let none know my design. And the Wazir could
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not oppose him. Then the King changed his dress and ornaments
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, slinging his sword over his shoulder, took a path which led"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up one of the mountains and marched for the rest of the night
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till morning dawned; nor did he cease wayfaring till the heat was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"too much for him. After his long walk he rested for a while, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,then resumed his march and fared on through the second night till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dawn, when suddenly there appeared a black point in the far"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"distance. Hereat he rejoiced and said to himself, Haply some one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,here shall acquaint me with the mystery of the tarn and its
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fishes. Presently drawing near the dark object he found it a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"palace built of swart stone plated with iron; and, while one leaf"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the gate stood wide open, the other was shut, The King's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,spirits rose high as he stood before the gate and rapped a light
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rap; but hearing no answer he knocked a second knock and a third;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,yet there came no sign. Then he knocked his loudest but still no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answer, so he said, Doubtless 'tis empty. Thereupon he mustered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up resolution and boldly walked through the main gate into the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"great hall and there cried out aloud, Holla, ye people of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,palace! I am a stranger and a wayfarer; have you aught here of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,victual? He repeated his cry a second time and a third but still
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there came no reply; so strengthening his heart and making up his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mind he stalked through the vestibule into the very middle of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,palace and found no man in it. Yet it was furnished with silken
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stuffs gold starred; and the hangings were let down over the door
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ways. In the midst was a spacious court off which set four open
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saloons each with its raised dais, saloon facing saloon; a canopy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shaded the court and in the centre was a jetting fount with four
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"figures of lions made of red gold, spouting from their mouths"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,water clear as pearls and diaphanous gems. Round about the palace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"birds were let loose and over it stretched a net of golden wire,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hindering them from flying off; in brief there was everything but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"human beings. The King marvelled mightily thereat, yet felt he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sad at heart for that he saw no one to give him account of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waste and its tarn, the fishes, the mountains and the palace"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,itself. Presently as he sat between the doors in deep thought
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"behold, there came a voice of lament, as from a heart grief spent"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he heard the voice chanting these verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I hid what I endured of him[FN#110] and yet it came to light, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     And nightly sleep mine eyelids fled and changed to sleepless
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     night:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Oh world! Oh Fate! withhold thy hand and cease thy hurt and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     harm * Look and behold my hapless sprite in colour and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     affright:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wilt ne'er show ruth to highborn youth who lost him on the way *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Of Love, and fell from wealth and fame to lowest basest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     wight.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Jealous of Zephyr's breath was I as on your form he breathed *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     But whenas Destiny descends she blindeth human sight[FN#111]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,What shall the hapless archer do who when he fronts his foe * And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bends his bow to shoot the shaft shall find his string
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     undight?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When cark and care so heavy bear on youth[FN#112] of generous
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     soul * How shall he 'scape his lot and where from Fate his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     place of flight?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Now when the Sultan heard the mournful voice he sprang to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feet; and, following the sound, found a curtain let down over a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chamber door. He raised it and saw behind it a young man sitting
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon a couch about a cubit above the ground; and he fair to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sight, a well shaped wight, with eloquence dight; his forehead"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was flower white, his cheek rosy bright, and a mole on his cheek"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,breadth like an ambergris mite; even as the poet cloth indite:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,A youth slim waisted from whose locks and brow * The world in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     blackness and in light is set.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Throughout Creation's round no fairer show * No rarer sight thine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     eye hath ever met:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,A nut brown mole sits throned upon a cheek * Of rosiest red
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     beneath an eye of jet.[FN#113]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The King rejoiced and saluted him, but he remained sitting in his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,caftan of silken stuff pureed with Egyptian gold and his crown
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,studded with gems of sorts; but his face was sad with the traces
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of sorrow. He returned the royal salute in most courteous wise
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"adding, O my lord, thy dignity demandeth my rising to thee; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my sole excuse is to crave thy pardon.[FN#114] Quoth the King,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou art excused, O youth; so look upon me as thy guest come"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hither on an especial object. I would thou acquaint me with the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,secrets of this tarn and its fishes and of this palace and thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loneliness therein and the cause of thy groaning and wailing.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the young man heard these words he wept with sore
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,weeping;[FN#115] till his bosom was drenched with tears and began
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,reciting--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Say him who careless sleeps what while the shaft of Fortune flies
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     * How many cloth this shifting world lay low and raise to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     rise?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Although thine eye be sealed in sleep, sleep not th' Almighty's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     eyes * And who hath found Time ever fair, or Fate in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     constant guise?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he sighed a long fetched sigh and recited:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Confide thy case to Him, the Lord who made mankind; * Quit cark"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and care and cultivate content of mind;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ask not the Past or how or why it came to pass: * All human
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     things by Fate and Destiny were designed!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The King marvelled and asked him, What maketh thee weep, O young"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man? and he answered, How should I not weep, when this is my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,case! Thereupon he put out his hand and raised the skirt of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"garment, when lo! the lower half of him appeared stone down to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his feet while from his navel to the hair of his head he was man.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The King, seeing this his plight, grieved with sore grief and of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his compassion cried, Alack and well away! in very sooth, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"youth, thou heapest sorrow upon my sorrow. I was minded to ask"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee the mystery of the fishes only: whereas now I am concerned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to learn thy story as well as theirs. But there is no Majesty and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great![FN#116]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Lose no time, O youth, but tell me forthright thy whole tale."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth he, Lend me thine ears, thy sight and thine insight; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth the King, All are at thy service! Thereupon the youth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"began, Right wondrous and marvellous is my case and that of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these fishes; and were it graven with gravers upon the eye
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,corners it were a warner to whoso would be warned. How is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that? asked the King, and the young man began to tell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Tale of the Ensorcelled Prince.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know then, O my lord, that whilome my sire was King of this city,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and his name was Mahmud, entitled Lord of the Black Islands, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,owner of what are now these four mountains. He ruled three score
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and ten years, after which he went to the mercy of the Lord and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reigned as Sultan in his stead. I took to wife my cousin, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter of my paternal uncle,[FN#117] and she loved me with such"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,abounding love that whenever I was absent she ate not and she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drank not until she saw me again. She cohabited with me for five
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,years till a certain day when she went forth to the Hammam bath;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I bade the cook hasten to get ready all requisites for our
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,supper. And I entered this palace and lay down on the bed where I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was wont to sleep and bade two damsels to fan my face, one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sitting by my head and the other at my feet. But I was troubled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and made restless by my wife's absence and could not sleep; for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,although my eyes were closed my mind and thoughts were wide
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,awake. Presently I heard the slave girl at my head say to her at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my feet, O Mas'udah, how miserable is our master and how wasted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in his youth and oh! the pity of his being so be trayed by our
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mistress, the accursed whore!''[FN#118] The other replied, Yes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,indeed: Allah curse all faithless women and adulterous; but the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like of our master, with his fair gifts, deserveth something"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,better than this harlot who lieth abroad every night. Then quoth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she who sat by my head, Is our lord dumb or fit only for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bubbling that he questioneth her not! and quoth the other, Fie"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on thee! cloth our lord know her ways or cloth she allow him his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"choice? Nay, more, cloth she not drug every night the cup she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"giveth him to drink before sleep time, and put Bhang[FN#119] into"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it? So he sleepeth and wotteth not whither she goeth, nor what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she doeth; but we know that after giving him the drugged wine,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she donneth her richest raiment and perfumeth herself and then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she fareth out from him to be away till break of day; then she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cometh to him, and burneth a pastile under his nose and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,awaketh from his deathlike sleep. When I heard the slave girl's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"words, the light became black before my sight and I thought night"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would never-fall. Presently the daughter of my uncle came from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the baths; and they set the table for us and we ate and sat
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,together a fair half hour quaffing our wine as was ever our wont.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then she called for the particular wine I used to drink before
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sleeping and reached me the cup; but, seeming to drink it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"according to my wont, I poured the contents into my bosom; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lying down, let her hear that I was asleep. Then, behold, she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried, Sleep out the night, and never wake again: by Allah, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loathe thee and I loathe thy whole body, and my soul turneth in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disgust from cohabiting with thee; and I see not the moment when
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah shall snatch away thy life! Then she rose and donned her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fairest dress and perfumed her person and slung my sword over her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shoulder; and, opening the gates of the palace, went her ill way."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I rose and followed her as she left the palace and she threaded
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the streets until she came to the city gate, where she spoke"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"words I understood not, and the padlocks dropped of themselves as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,if broken and the gate leaves opened. She went forth (and I after
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her without her noticing aught) till she came at last to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,outlying mounds[FN#120] and a reed fence built about a round
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"roofed hut of mud bricks. As she entered the door, I climbed upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the roof which commanded a view of the interior, and lo! my fair"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cousin had gone in to a hideous negro slave with his upper lip
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like the cover of a pot, and his lower like an open pot; lips"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which might sweep up sand from the gravel-floor of the cot. He
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was to boot a leper and a paralytic, lying upon a strew of sugar"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cane trash and wrapped in an old blanket and the foulest rags and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tatters. She kissed the earth before him, and he raised his head"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so as to see her and said, Woe to thee! what call hadst thou to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stay away all this time? Here have been with me sundry of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"black brethren, who drank their wine and each had his young lady,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I was not content to drink because of thine absence. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she, O my lord, my heart's love and coolth of my eyes [FN#121]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,knowest thou not that I am married to my cousin whose very look I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loathe, and hate myself when in his company? And did not I fear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for thy sake, I would not let a single sun arise before making"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his city a ruined heap wherein raven should croak and howlet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hoot, and jackal and wolf harbour and loot; nay I had removed its"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,very stones to the back side of Mount Kaf. [FN#122] Rejoined the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slave, Thou liest, damn thee! Now I swear an oath by the velour"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and honour of blackamoor men (and deem not our manliness to be ;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the poor manliness of white men), from today forth if thou stay"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"away till this hour, I will not keep company with thee nor will I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,glue my body with thy body and strum and belly bump Dost play
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fast and loose with us, thou cracked pot, that we may satisfy thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dirty lusts? stinkard! bitch! vilest of the vile whites! When I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard his words, and saw with my own eyes what passed between"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"these two wretches, the world waxed dark be fore my face and my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"soul knew not in what place it was. But , my wife humbly stood up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"weeping before and wheedling the slave, and saying, O my beloved,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and very fruit of my heart, there is none left to cheer me but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy dear self; and, if thou cast me off who shall take me in, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my beloved, O light of my eyes? And she ceased not weeping and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,abasing herself to him until he deigned be reconciled with her.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then was she right glad and stood up and doffed her clothes, even"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to her petticoat trousers, and said, 0 my master what hast thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"here for thy handmaiden to eat? Uncover the basin, he grumbled,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and thou shalt find t the bottom the broiled bones of some rats
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"we dined on, pick at them, and then go to that slop pot where"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou shalt find some leavings of beer [FN#123] which thou mayest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"drink. So she ate and drank and washed her hands, and went and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lay down by the side of the slave, upon the cane trash and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stripping herself stark naked, she crept in with him under his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"foul coverlet and his rags and tatters. When I saw my wife, my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cousin, the daughter of my uncle, do this deed[FN#124] I clean"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lost my wits, and climbing down from the roof, I entered and took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the sword which she had with her and drew it, determined to cut"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down the twain. I first struck at the slave's neck and thought
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that the death decree had fallen on him:And Shahrazad perceived
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                 When it was the Eighth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young ensorcelled Prince said to the King, When I smote the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slave with intent to strike off his head, I thought that I had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slain him; for he groaned a loud hissing groan, but I had cut"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,only the skin and flesh of the gullet and the two arteries! It
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"awoke the daughter of my uncle, so I sheathed the sword and fared"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forth for the city; and, entering the palace, lay upon my bed and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slept till morning when my wife aroused me and I saw that she had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cut off her hair and had donned mourning garments. Quoth she:--O
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son of my uncle, blame me not for what I do; it hath just reached"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me that my mother is dead, and my father hath been killed in holy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"war, and of my brothers one hath lost his life by a snake sting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the other by falling down some precipice; and I can and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,should do naught save weep and lament. When I heard her words I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,refrained from all reproach and said only:--Do as thou list; I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"certainly will not thwart thee. She continued sorrowing, weeping"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and wailing one whole year from the beginning of its circle to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the end, and when it was finished she said to me.--I wish to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"build me in thy palace a tomb with a cupola, which I will set"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,apart for my mourning and will name the House of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Lamentations.[FN#125] Quoth I again:--Do as thou list! Then she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"builded for herself a cenotaph wherein to mourn, and set on its"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,centre a dome under which showed a tomb like a Santon's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sepulchre. Thither she carried the slave and lodged him; but he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was exceeding weak by reason of his wound, and unable to do her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,love service; he could only drink wine and from the day of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hurt he spake not a word, yet he lived on because his appointed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hour[FN#126] was not come. Every day, morning and evening, my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wife went to him and wept and wailed over him and gave him wine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and strong soups, and left not off doing after this manner a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,second year; and I bore with her patiently and paid no heed to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her. One day, however, I went in to her unawares; and I found her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,weeping and beating her face and crying:--Why art thou absent
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from my sight, O my heart's delight? Speak to me, O my life; talk"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with me, O my love? Then she recited these verses:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,For your love my patience fails and albeit you forget * I may
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     not, nor to other love my heart can make reply:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bear my body, bear my soul wheresoever you may fare * And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     where you pitch the camp let my body buried lie:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Cry my name above my grave, and an answer shall return * The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     moaning of my bones responsive to your cry.[FN#127]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then she recited, weeping bitterly the while:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The day of my delight is the day when draw you near * And the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     day of mine affright is the day you turn away:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Though I tremble through the night in my bitter dread of death *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     When I hold you in my arms I am free from all affray
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Once more she began reciting:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Though a morn I may awake with all happiness in hand *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Though the world all be mine and like Kisra-kings[FN#128] I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     reign;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,To me they had the worth of the winglet of the gnat * When I fail
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     to see thy form, when I look for thee in vain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When she had ended for a time her words and her weeping I said to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her--O my cousin, let this thy mourning suffice, for in pouring"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forth tears there is little profit! Thwart me not, answered she,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in aught I do, or I will lay violent hands on myself! So I held"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my peace and left her to go her own way; and she ceased not to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cry and keen and indulge her affliction for yet another year. At
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the end of the third year I waxed aweary of this lonesome
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mourning, and one day I happened to enter the cenotaph when vexed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and angry with some matter which had thwarted me, and suddenly I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard her say:--O my lord, I never hear thee vouch safe a single"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"word to me! Why cost thou not answer me, O my master? and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,began reciting:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O thou tomb! O, thou tomb! be his beauty set in shade? * Hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thou darkened that countenance all sheeny as the noon?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,O thou tomb! neither earth nor yet heaven art to me * Then how
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     cometh it in thee are conjoined my sun and moon?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When I heard such verses as these rage was heaped upon my rage I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cried out:--Well away! how long is this sorrow to last? and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,began repeating:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,O thou tomb! O thou tomb! be his horrors set in blight? * Hast
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thou dark ened his countenance that sickeneth the soul?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,O thou tomb! neither cess pool nor pipkin art to me * Then how
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     cometh it in thee are conjoined soil and coal?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When she heard my words she sprang to her feet crying.--Fie upon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee, thou cur! all this is of thy doings; thou hast wounded my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heart s darling and thereby worked me sore woe and thou hast
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wasted his youth so that these three years he hath lain abed more
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dead than alive! In my wrath I cried:--O thou foulest of harlots
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and filthiest of whores ever futtered by negro slaves who are
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hired to have at thee![FN#129] Yes indeed it was I who did this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,good deed; and snatching up my sword I drew it and made at her to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cut her down. But she laughed my words and mine intent to scorn
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crying: To heel, hound that thou art! Alas[FN#130] for the past"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which shall no more come to pass nor shall any one avail the dead
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to raise. Allah hath indeed now given into my hand him who did to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me this thing, a deed that hath burned my heart with a fire which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,died not and a flame which might not be quenched! Then she stood
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"up; and, pronouncing some words to me unintelligible, she said:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,By virtue of my egromancy become thou half stone and half man;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereupon I became what thou seest, unable to rise or to sit, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,neither dead nor alive. Moreover she ensorcelled the city with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all its streets and garths, and she turned by her gramarye the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,four islands into four mountains around the tarn whereof thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"questionest me; and the citizens, who were of four different"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"faiths, Moslem, Nazarene, Jew and Magian, she transformed by her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"enchantments into fishes; the Moslems are the white, the Magians"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"red, the Christians blue and the Jews yellow.[FN#131] And every"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"day she tortureth me and scourgeth me with an hundred stripes,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,each of which draweth floods of blood and cutteth the skin of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shoulders to strips; and lastly she clotheth my upper half with a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hair cloth and then throweth over them these robes. Hereupon the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,young man again shed tears and began reciting:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"In patience, O my God, I endure my lot and fate; * I will bear at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     will of Thee whatsoever be my state:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,They oppress me; they torture me; they make my life a woe * Yet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     haply Heaven's happiness shall compensate my strait:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Yea, straitened is my life by the bane and hate o' foes * But"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Mustafa and Murtaza[FN#132] shall ope me Heaven's gate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"After this the Sultan turned towards the young Prince and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O youth, thou hast removed one grief only to add another grief;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but now, O my friend, where is she; and where is the mausoleum"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wherein lieth the wounded slave? The slave lieth under yon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dome, quoth the young man, and she sitteth in the chamber"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fronting yonder door. And every day at sunrise she cometh forth,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and first strippeth me, and whippeth me with an hundred strokes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the leathern scourge, and I weep and shriek; but there is no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,power of motion in my lower limbs to keep her off me. After
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ending her tormenting me she visiteth the slave, bringing him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wine and boiled meats. And to morrow at an early hour she will be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"here. Quoth the King, By Allah, O youth, I will as suredly do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee a good deed which the world shall not willingly let die, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,an act of derring do which shall be chronicled long after I am
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dead and gone by. Then the King sat him by the side of the young
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Prince and talked till nightfall, when he lay down and slept;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but, as soon as the false dawn[FN#133] showed, he arose and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,doffing his outer garments[FN#134] bared his blade and hastened
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to the place wherein lay the slave. Then was he ware of lighted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"candles and lamps, and the perfume of incenses and unguents, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"directed by these, he made for the slave and struck him one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stroke killing him on the spot: after which he lifted him on his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,back and threw him into a well that was in the palace. Presentry
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he returned and, donning the slave's gear, lay down at length"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,within the mausoleum with the drawn sword laid close to and along
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his side. After an hour or so the accursed witch came; and, first"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"going to her husband, she stripped off his clothes and, taking a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whip, flogged him cruelly while he cried out, Ah! enough for me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the case I am in! take pity on me, O my cousin!' But she replied,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Didst thou take pity on me and spare the life of my true love on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whom I coated? Then she drew the cilice over his raw and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bleeding skin and threw the robe upon all and went down to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slave with a goblet of wine and a bowl of meat broth in her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hands. She entered under the dome weeping and wailing,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Well-away! and crying, O my lord! speak a word to me! O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,master! talk awhile with me! and began to recite these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,couplets.--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"How long this harshness, this unlove, shall bide? * Suffice thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     not tear floods thou hast espied?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thou cost prolong our parting purposely * And if wouldst please
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     my foe, thou'rt satisfied!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then she wept again and said, O my lord! speak to me, talk with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me! The King lowered his voice and, twisting his tongue, spoke"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after the fashion of the blackamoors and said 'lack! 'lack!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there be no Ma'esty and there be no Might save in Allauh, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Gloriose, the Great! Now when she heard these words she shouted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for joy, and fell to the ground fainting; and when her senses"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned she asked, O my lord, can it be true that thou hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,power of speech? and the King making his voice small and faint
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, O my cuss! cost thou deserve that I talk to thee and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,speak with thee? Why and wherefore? rejoined she; and he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,replied The why is that all the livelong day thou tormentest thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hubby; and he keeps calling on 'eaven for aid until sleep is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"strange to me even from evenin' till mawnin', and he prays and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"damns, cussing us two, me and thee, causing me disquiet and much"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bother: were this not so, I should long ago have got my health;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and it is this which prevents my answering thee. Quoth she,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,With thy leave I will release him from what spell is on him;and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth the King, Release him and let's have some rest! She"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried, To hear is to obey; and, going from the cenotaph to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"palace, she took a metal bowl and filled it with water and spake"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,over it certain words which made the contents bubble and boil as
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a cauldron seetheth over the fire. With this she sprinkled her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"husband saying, By virtue of the dread words I have spoken, if"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou becamest thus by my spells, come forth out of that form into"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shine own former form. And lo and behold! the young man shook
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and trembled; then he rose to his feet and, rejoicing at his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deliverance, cried aloud, I testify that there is no god but the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"God, and in very truth Mohammed is His Apostle, whom Allah bless"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and keep! Then she said to him, Go forth and return not hither,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for if thou do I will surely slay thee; screaming these words in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his face. So he went from between her hands; and she returned to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the dome and, going down to the sepulchre, she said, O my lord,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,come forth to me that I may look upon thee and thy goodliness!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The King replied in faint low words, What[FN#135] thing hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou done? Thou hast rid me of the branch but not of the root.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She asked, O my darling! O my negro ring! what is the root? And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he answered, Fie on thee, O my cuss! The people of this city and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the four islands every night when it's half passed lift their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heads from the tank in which thou hast turned them to fishes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cry to Heaven and call down its anger on me and thee; and this is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the reason why my body's baulked from health. Go at once and set
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them free then come to me and take my hand, and raise me up, for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a little strength is already back in me. When she heard the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King's words (and she still supposed him to be the slave) she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried joyously, O my master, on my head and on my eyes be thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"commend, Bismillah[FN#136]!'' So she sprang to her feet and, full"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of joy and gladness, ran down to the tarn and took a little of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,its water n the palm of her hand--And Shahrazad perceived the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                  When it Was the Ninth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young woman, the sorceress, took in hand some of the tarn water"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and spake over it words not to be understood, the fishes lifted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their heads and stood up on the instant like men, the spell on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the people of the city having been removed. What was the lake
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,again became a crowded capital; the bazars were thronged with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,folk who bought and sold; each citizen was occupied with his own
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,calling and the four hills became islands as they were whilome.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then the young woman, that wicked sorceress, returned to the King"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and (still thinking he was the negro) said to him, O my love!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stretch forth thy honoured hand that I may assist thee to rise.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nearer to me, quoth the King in a faint and feigned tone. She"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came close as to embrace him when he took up the sword lying hid
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"by his side and smote her across the breast, so that the point"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,showed gleaming behind her back. Then he smote her a second time
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and cut her in twain and cast her to the ground in two halves.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"After which he fared forth and found the young man, now freed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from the spell, awaiting him and gave him joy of his happy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,release while the Prince kissed his hand with abundant thanks.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth the King, Wilt thou abide in this city or go with me to my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"capital? Quoth the youth, O King of the age, wottest thou not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what journey is between thee and thy city? Two days and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"half, answered he, whereupon said the other, An thou be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sleeping, O King, awake! Between thee and thy city is a year's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"march for a well girt walker, and thou haddest not come hither in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,two days and a half save that the city was under enchantment. And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I, O King, will never part from thee; no, not even for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"twinkling of an eye. The King rejoiced at his words and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thanks be to Allah who hath bestowed thee upon me! From this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hour thou art my son and my only son, for that in all my life I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have never been blessed with issue. Thereupon they embraced and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"joyed with exceeding great joy; and, reaching the palace, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Prince who had been spell bound informed his lords and his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grandees that he was about to visit the Holy Places as a pilgrim,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and bade them get ready all things necessary for the occasion.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The preparations lasted ten days, after which he set out with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sultan, whose heart burned in yearning for his city whence he had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,been absent a whole twelvemonth. They journeyed with an escort of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Mamelukes[FN#137] carrying all manners of precious gifts and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rarities, nor stinted they wayfaring day and night for a full"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"year until they approached the Sultan's capital, and sent on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,messengers to announce their coming. Then the Wazir and the whole
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"army came out to meet him in joy and gladness, for they had given"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up all hope of ever seeing their King; and the troops kissed the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ground before him and wished him joy of his safety. He entered
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and took seat upon his throne and the Minister came before him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, when acquainted with all that had be fallen the young"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Prince, he congratulated him on his narrow escape. When order was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,restored throughout the land the King gave largesse to many of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his people, and said to the Wazir, Hither the Fisherman who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brought us the fishes! So he sent for the man who had been the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,first cause of the city and the citizens being delivered from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"enchantment and, when he came in to the presence, the Sultan"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bestowed upon him a dress of honour, and questioned him of his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,condition and whether he had children. The Fisherman gave him to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"know that he had two daughters and a son, so the King sent for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them and, taking one daughter to wife, gave the other to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,young Prince and made the son his head treasurer. Furthermore he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,invested his Wazir with the Sultanate of the City in the Black
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Islands whilome belonging to the young Prince, and dispatched"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with him the escort of fifty armed slaves together with dresses
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of honour for all the Emirs and Grandees. The Wazir kissed hands
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and fared forth on his way; while the Sultan and the Prince abode
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at home in all the solace and the delight of life; and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Fisherman became the richest man of his age, and his daughters"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wived with Kings, until death came to them. And yet, O King!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this is not more wondrous than the story of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,          The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Once upon a time there was a Porter in Baghdad, who was a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bachelor and who would remain unmarried. It came to pass on a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"certain day, as he stood about the street leaning idly upon his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crate, behold, there stood before him an honourable woman in a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mantilla of Mosul[FN#138] silk, broidered with gold and bordered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with brocade; her walking shoes were also purfled with gold and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her hair floated in long plaits. She raised her face veil[FN#139]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, showing two black eyes fringed with jetty lashes, whose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,glances were soft and languishing and whose perfect beauty was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ever blandishing, she accosted the Porter and said in the suavest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tones and choicest language, Take up thy crate and follow me."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Porter was so dazzled he could hardly believe that he heard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her aright, but he shouldered his basket in hot haste saying in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself, O day of good luck! O day of Allah's grace! and walked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after her till she stopped at the door of a house. There she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rapped, and presently came out to her an old man, a Nazarene, to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whom she gave a gold piece, receiving from him in return what she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,required of strained wine clear as olive oil; and she set it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"safely in the hamper, saying Lift and follow. Quoth the Porter,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"This, by Allah, is indeed an auspicious day, a day propitious"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for the granting of all a man wisheth. He again hoisted up the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,crate and followed her; till she stopped at a fruiterer's shop
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and bought from him Shami[FN#140] apples and Osmani quinces and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Omani[FN#141] peaches, and cucumbers of Nile growth, and Egyptian"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"limes and Sultani oranges and citrons; besides Aleppine jasmine,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"scented myrtle berries, Damascene nenuphars, flower of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"privet[FN#142] and camomile, blood red anemones, violets, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pomegranate bloom, eglantine and narcissus, and set the whole in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Porter's crate, saying, Up with it. So he lifted and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"followed her till she stopped at a butcher's booth and said, Cut"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me off ten pounds of mutton. She paid him his price and he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wrapped it in a banana leaf, whereupon she laid it in the crate"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said Hoist, O Porter. He hoisted accordingly, and followed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her as she walked on till she stopped at a grocer's, where she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bought dry fruits and pistachio kernels, Tihamah raisins, shelled"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"almonds and all wanted for dessert, and said to the Porter, Lift"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and follow me. So he up with his hamper and after her till she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stayed at the confectioner's, and she bought an earthen platter,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and piled it with all kinds of sweetmeats in his shop, open"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"worked tarts and fritters scented with musk and soap cakes, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lemon loaves and melon preserves,[FN#143] and Zaynab's combs,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and ladies' fingers, and Kazi's tit-bits and goodies of every"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,description; and placed the platter in the Porter's crate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thereupon quoth he (being a merry man), Thou shouldest have told"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, and I would have brought with me a pony or a she camel to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,carry all this market stuff. She smiled and gave him a little
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cuff on the nape saying, Step out and exceed not in words for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,(Allah willing!) thy wage will not be wanting. Then she stopped
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at a perfumer's and took from him ten sorts of waters, rose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"scented with musk, grange Lower, waterlily, willow flower, violet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and five others; and she also bought two loaves of sugar, a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bottle for perfume spraying, a lump of male in cense, aloe wood,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ambergris and musk, with candles of Alex' andria wax; and she put"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the whole into the basket, saying, Up with thy crate and after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me. He did so and followed until she stood before the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"greengrocer's, of whom she bought pickled safflower and olives,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in brine and in oil; with tarragon and cream cheese and hard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Syrian cheese; and she stowed them away in the crate saying to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Porter, Take up thy basket and follow me. He did so and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went after her till she came to a fair mansion fronted by a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spacious court, a tall, fine place to which columns gave strength"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and grace: and the gate thereof had two leaves of ebony inlaid
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with plates of red gold. The lady stopped at the door and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"turning her face veil sideways, knocked softly with her knuckles"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whilst the Porter stood behind her, thinking of naught save her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,beauty and loveliness. Presently the door swung back and both
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leaves were opened, whereupon he looked to see who had opened it;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and behold, it was a lady of tall figure, some five feet high; a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"model of beauty and loveliness, brilliance and symmetry and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perfect grace. Her forehead was flower white; her cheeks like the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,anemone ruddy bright; her eyes were those of the wild heifer or
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the gazelle, with eyebrows like the crescent moon which ends"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Sha'aban and begins Ramazan;[FN#144] her mouth was the ring of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sulayman,[FN#145] her lips coral red, and her teeth like a line"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of strung pearls or of camomile petals. Her throat recalled the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"antelope's, and her breasts, like two pomegranates of even size,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stood at bay as it were,[FN#146] her body rose and fell in waves"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"below her dress like the rolls of a piece of brocade, and her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,navel[FN#147] would hold an ounce of benzoin ointment. In fine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she was like her of whom the poet said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,On Sun and Moon of palace cast thy sight * Enjoy her flower like
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     face, her fragrant light:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thine eyes shall never see in hair so black * Beauty encase a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     brow so purely white:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The ruddy rosy cheek proclaims her claim * Though fail her name
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     whose beauties we indite:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,As sways her gait I smile at hips so big * And weep to see the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     waist they bear so slight.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When the Porter looked upon her his wits were waylaid, and his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,senses were stormed so that his crate went nigh to fall from his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"head, and he said to himself, Never have I in my life seen a day"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,more blessed than this day! Then quoth the lady portress to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady cateress, Come in from the gate and relieve this poor man"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of his load. So the provisioner went in followed by the portress
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the Porter and went on till they reached a spacious ground
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"floor hall,[FN#148] built with admirable skill and beautified"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with all manner colours and carvings; with upper balconies and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,groined arches and galleries and cupboards and recesses whose
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,curtains hung before them. In the midst stood a great basin full
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of water surrounding a fine fountain, and at the upper end on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"raised dais was a couch of juniper wood set with gems and pearls,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with a canopy like mosquito curtains of red satin silk looped up
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with pearls as big as filberts and bigger. Thereupon sat a lady
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bright of blee, with brow beaming brilliancy, the dream of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"philosophy, whose eyes were fraught with Babel's gramarye[FN#149]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and her eye brows were arched as for archery; her breath breathed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ambergris and perfumery and her lips were sugar to taste and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,carnelian to see. Her stature was straight as the letter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I[FN#150] and her face shamed the noon sun's radiancy; and she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was even as a galaxy, or a dome with golden marquetry or a bride"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,displayed in choicest finery or a noble maid of Araby.[FN#151]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Right well of her sang the bard when he said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Her smiles twin rows of pearls display * Chamomile-buds or rimey
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     spray
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Her tresses stray as night let down * And shames her light the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     dawn o' day.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#152]The third lady rising from the couch stepped forward with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grace ful swaying gait till she reached the middle of the saloon,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when she said to her sisters, Why stand ye here? take it down"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from this poor man's head! Then the cateress went and stood
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before him, and the portress behind him while the third helped"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them, and they lifted the load from the Porter's head; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"emptying it of all that was therein, set everything in its place."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Lastly they gave him two gold pieces, saying, Wend thy ways, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Porter. But he went not, for he stood looking at the ladies and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"admiring what uncommon beauty was theirs, and their pleasant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,manners and kindly dispositions (never had he seen goodlier); and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he gazed wistfully at that good store of wines and sweet scented
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,flowers and fruits and other matters. Also he marvelled with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding marvel, especially to see no man in the place and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"delayed his going; whereupon quoth the eldest lady, What aileth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee that goest not; haply thy wage be too little? And, turning"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to her sister the cateress, she said, Give him another diner!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But the Porter answered, By Allah, my lady, it is not for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wage; my hire is never more than two dirhams; but in very sooth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my heart and my soul are taken up with you and your condition. I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wonder to see you single with ne'er a man about you and not a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,soul to bear you company; and well you wot that the minaret
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"toppleth o'er unless it stand upon four, and you want this same"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fourth; and women's pleasure without man is short of measure,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,even as the poet said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Seest not we want for joy four things all told * The harp and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     lute, the flute and flageolet;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And be they companied with scents four fold * Rose, myrtle,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     anemone and violet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Nor please all eight an four thou wouldst withold * Good wine and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     youth and gold and pretty pet.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,You be there and want a fourth who shall be a person of good
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sense and prudence; smart witted, and one apt to keep careful"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,counsel. His words pleased and amused them much; and they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"laughed at him and said, And who is to assure us of that? We are"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,maidens and we fear to entrust our secret where it may not be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kept, for we have read in a certain chronicle the lines of one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ibn al-Sumam:-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hold fast thy secret and to none unfold * Lost is a secret when
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     that secret's told
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,An fail thy breast thy secret to conceal * How canst thou hope
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     another's breast shall hold?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And Abu Nowás[FN#153] said well on the same subject:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Who trusteth secret to another's hand * Upon his brow deserveth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     burn of brand!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When the Porter heard their words he rejoined, By your lives! I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"am a man of sense and a discreet, who hath read books and perused"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chronicles; I reveal the fair and conceal the foul and I act as
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the poet adviseth:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,None but the good a secret keep * And good men keep it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     unrevealed:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,It is to me a well shut house * With keyless locks and door
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     ensealed[FN#154]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the maidens heard his verse and its poetical application
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"addressed to them they said, Thou knowest that we have laid out"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all our monies on this place. Now say, hast thou aught to offer"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,us in return for entertainment? For surely we will not suf fer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee to sit in our company and be our cup companion, and gaze"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon our faces so fair and so rare without paying a round
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sum.[FN#155] Wottest thou not the saying:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Sans hope of gain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Love's not worth a grain?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Whereto the lady portress added, If thou bring anything thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a something; if no thing, be off with thee, thou art a nothing;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but the procuratrix interposed, saying, Nay, O my sisters, leave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"teasing him for by Allah he hath not failed us this day, and had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he been other he never had kept patience with me, so whatever be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his shot and scot I will take it upon myself. The Porter, over"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"joyed, kissed the ground before her and thanked her saying, By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, these monies are the first fruits this day hath given me."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hearing this they said, Sit thee down and welcome to thee, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the eldest lady added, By Allah, we may not suffer thee to join"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us save on one condition, and this it is, that no questions be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asked as to what concerneth thee not, and frowardness shall be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"soundly flogged. Answered the Porter, I agree to this, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady, on my head and my eyes be it! Lookye, I am dumb, I have no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tongue. Then arose the provisioneress and tightening her girdle
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,set the table by the fountain and put the flowers and sweet herbs
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in their jars, and strained the wine and ranged the flasks in row"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and made ready every requisite. Then sat she down, she and her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sisters, placing amidst them the Porter who kept deeming himself"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in a dream; and she took up the wine flagon, and poured out the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"first cup and drank it off, and likewise a second and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,third.[FN#156] After this she filled a fourth cup which she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"handed to one of her sisters; and, lastly, she crowned a goblet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and passed it to the Porter, saying:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Drink the dear draught, drink free and fain * What healeth every"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     grief and pain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"He took the cup in his hand and, louting low, returned his best"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thanks and improvised:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Drain not the bowl save with a trusty friend * A man of worth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     whose good old
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"For wine, like wind, sucks sweetness from the sweet * And stinks"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     when over stench it haply blow:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Adding:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Drain not the bowl; save from dear hand like thine * The cup
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     recall thy gifts; thou, gifts of wine."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,After repeating this couplet he kissed their hands and drank and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was drunk and sat swaying from side to side and pursued:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,All drinks wherein is blood the Law unclean * Doth hold save
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     one, the blood shed of the vine:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Fill! fill! take all my wealth bequeathed or won * Thou fawn! a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     willing ransom for those eyne.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then the cateress crowned a cup and gave it to the portress, who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took it from her hand and thanked her and drank. Thereupon she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"poured again and passed to the eldest lady who sat on the couch,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and filled yet another and handed it to the Porter. He kissed the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ground before them; and, after drinking and thanking them, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,again began to recite :
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Here! Here! by Allah, here! * Cups of the sweet, the dear'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy, Fill me a brimming bowl * The Fount o' Life I speer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then the Porter stood up before the mistress of the house and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, O lady, I am thy slave, thy Mameluke, thy white thrall, a,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy very bondsman; and he began reciting:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,A slave of slaves there standeth at thy door * Lauding thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     generous boons and gifts galore
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Beauty! may he come in awhile to 'joy * Thy charms? for Love
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and I part nevermore!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said to him, Drink; and health and happiness attend thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drink. So he took the cup and kissed her hand and recited these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lines in sing song:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I gave her brave old wine that like her cheeks * Blushed red or
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     flame from furnace flaring up:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,She bussed the brim and said with many a smile * How durst thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     deal folk's cheek for folk to sup?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Drink! (said I) these are tears of mine whose tinct * Is heart
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     blood sighs have boiled in the cup.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,She answered him in the following couplet:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"An tears of blood for me, friend, thou hast shed * Suffer me sup"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     them, by thy head and eyes!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then the lady took the cup, and drank it off to her sisters'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"health, and they ceased not drinking (the Porter being in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"midst of them), and dancing and laughing and reciting verses and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,singing ballads and ritornellos. All this time the Porter was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carrying on with them, kissing, toying, biting, handling,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"groping, fingering; whilst one thrust a dainty morsel in his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mouth, and another slapped him; and this cuffed his cheeks, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that threw sweet flowers at him; and he was in the very paradise
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of pleasure, as though he were sitting in the seventh sphere"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,among the Houris[FN#157] of Heaven. They ceased not doing after
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this fashion until the wine played tucks in their heads and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"worsted their wits; and, when the drink got the better of them,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the portress stood up and doffed her clothes till she was mother
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"naked. However, she let down her hair about her body by way of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shift, and throwing herself into the basin disported herself and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dived like a duck and swam up and down, and took water in her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mouth, and spurted it all over the Porter, and washed her limbs,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and between her breasts, and inside her thighs and all around her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,navel. Then she came up out of the cistern and throwing herself
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on the Porter's lap said, O my lord, O my love, what callest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou this article? pointing to her slit, her solution of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"continuity. I call that thy cleft, quoth the Porter, and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoined, Wah! wah, art thou not ashamed to use such a word? and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she caught him by the collar and soundly cuffed him. Said he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again, Thy womb, thy vulva; and she struck him a second slap"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crying, O fie, O fie, this is another ugly word; is here no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shame in thee? Quoth he, Thy coynte; and she cried, O thou!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,art wholly destitute of modesty? and thumped and bashed him.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then cried the Porter, Thy clitoris,[FN#158] whereat the eldest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady came down upon him with a yet sorer beating, and said, No;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he said,  'Tis so, and the Porter went on calling the same"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"commodity by sundry other names, but whatever he said they beat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him more and more till his neck ached and swelled with the blows
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he had gotten; and on this wise they made him a butt and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"laughing stock. At last he turned upon them asking, And what do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"you women call this article? Whereto the damsel made answer,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The basil of the bridges.[FN#159] Cried the Porter, Thank"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah for my safety: aid me and be thou propitious, O basil of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the bridges! They passed round the cup and tossed off the bowl
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again, when the second lady stood up; and, stripping off all her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clothes, cast herself into the cistern and did as the first had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,done; then she came out of the water and throwing her naked form
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on the Porter's lap pointed to her machine and said, O light of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mine eyes, do tell me what is the name of this concern? He"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied as before, Thy slit; and she rejoined, Hath such term"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,no shame for thee? and cuffed him and buffeted him till the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saloon rang with the blows. Then quoth she, O fie! O fie! how"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"canst thou say this without blushing? He suggested, The basil"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the bridges; but she would not have it and she said, No!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,no! and stuck him and slapped him on the back of the neck. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he began calling out all the names he knew, Thy slit, thy womb,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy coynte, thy clitoris; and the girls kept on saying, No!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"no! So he said, I stick to the basil of the bridges; and all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the three laughed till they fell on their backs and laid slaps on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his neck and said, No! no! that's not its proper name."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thereupon he cried, O my sisters, what is its name? and they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, What sayest thou to the husked sesame seed? Then the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cateress donned her clothes and they fell again to carousing, but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Porter kept moaning, Oh! and Oh! for his neck and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shoulders, and the cup passed merrily round and round again for a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,full hour. After that time the eldest and handsomest lady stood
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"up and stripped off her garments, whereupon the Porter took his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neck in hand, and rubbed and shampoo'd it, saying, My neck and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shoulders are on the way of Allah![FN#160] Then she threw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"herself into the basin, and swam and dived, sported and washed;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the Porter looked at her naked figure as though she had been
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a slice of the moon[FN#161] and at her face with the sheen of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Luna when at full, or like the dawn when it brighteneth, and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"noted her noble stature and shape, and those glorious forms that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,quivered as she went; for she was naked as the Lord made her.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he cried Alack! Alack!and began to address her, versifying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,If I liken thy shape to the bough when green * My likeness errs
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and I sore mistake it;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,For the bough is fairest when clad the most * And thou art
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fairest when mother naked.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When the lady heard his verses she came up out of the basin and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seating herself upon his lap and knees, pointed to her genitory"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, O my lordling, what be the name of this? Quoth he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The basil of the bridges; but she said, Bah, bah! Quoth he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The husked sesame; quoth she, Pooh, pooh! Then said he, Thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"womb; and she cried, Fie, Fie! art thou not ashamed of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thyself? and cuffed him on the nape of the neck. And whatever
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"name he gave declaring  'Tis so, she beat him and cried No!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"no! till at last he said, O my sisters, and what is its name?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She replied, It is entitled the Khan[FN#162] of Abu Mansur;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereupon the Porter replied, Ha! ha! O Allah be praised for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,safe deliverance! O Khan of Abu Mansur! Then she came forth and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dressed and the cup went round a full hour. At last the Porter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rose up, and stripping off all his clothes, jumped into the tank"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and swam about and washed under his bearded chin and armpits,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,even as they had done. Then he came out and threw himself into
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the first lady's lap and rested his arms upon the lap of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"portress, and reposed his legs in the lap of the cateress and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pointed to his prickle[FN#163] and said, O my mistresses, what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is the name of this article? All laughed at his words till they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell on their backs, and one said, Thy pintle! But he replied,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,No! and gave each one of them a bite by way of forfeit. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said they, Thy pizzle! but he cried No, and gave each of them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a hug; And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                  When it was the Tenth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth her sister Dunyazad, Finish for us thy story; and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, With joy and goodly greet It hath reached me, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"auspicious King, that the damsels stinted not saying to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Porter Thy prickle, thy pintle, thy pizzle, and he ceased not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kissing and biting and hugging until his heart was satisfied, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they laughed on till they could no more. At last one said, O our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother, what, then, is it called? Quoth he, Know ye not?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth they, No! Its veritable name, said he, is mule Burst"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all, which browseth on the basil of the bridges, and muncheth the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"husked sesame, and nighteth in the Khan of Abu Mansur. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"laughed they till they fell on their backs, and returned to their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carousel, and ceased not to be after this fashion till night"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"began to fall. Thereupon said they to the Porter,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"''Bismillah,[FN#164] O our master, up and on with those sorry old"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shoes of thine and turn thy face and show us the breadth of thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shoulders! Said he, By Allah, to part with my soul would be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,easier for me than departing from you: come let us join night to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"day, and tomorrow morning we will each wend our own way. My"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"life on you, said the procuratrix, suffer him to tarry with us,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that we may laugh at him: we may live out our lives and never
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"meet with his like, for surely he is a right merry rogue and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"witty.[FN#165] So they said, Thou must not remain with us this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night save on condition that thou submit to our commands, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that whatso thou seest, thou ask no questions there anent, nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"enquire of its cause. All right, rejoined he, and they said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Go read the writing over the door. So he rose and went to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,entrance and there found written in letters of gold wash; WHOSO
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"SPEAKETH OF WHAT CONCERNETH HIM NOT, SHALL HEAR WHAT PLEASETH HIM"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"NOT! [FN#166] The Porter said, Be ye witnesses against me that I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will not speak on whatso concerneth me not. Then the cateress
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arose, and set food before them and they ate; after which they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"changed their drinking place for an other, and she lighted the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lamps and candles and burned amber gris and aloes wood, and set"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on fresh fruit and the wine service, when they fell to carousing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and talking of their lovers. And they ceased not to eat and drink
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and chat, nibbling dry fruits and laughing and playing tricks for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the space of a full hour when lo! a knock was heard at the gate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The knocking in no wise dis turbed the seance, but one of them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rose and went to see what it was and presently returned, saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Truly our pleasure for this night is to be perfect. How is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that? asked they; and she answered, At the gate be three"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Persian Kalandars[FN#167] with their beards and heads and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eyebrows shaven; and all three blind of the left eye--which is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,surely a strange chance. They are foreigners from Roum-land with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the mark of travel plain upon them; they have just entered
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Baghdad, this being their first visit to our city; and the cause"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of their knocking at our door is simply because they cannot find
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a lodging. Indeed one of them said to me:--Haply the owner of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this mansion will let us have the key of his stable or some old
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out house wherein we may pass this night; for evening had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"surprised them and, being strangers in the land, they knew none"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who would give them shelter. And, O my sisters, each of them is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,figure o' fun after his own fashion; and if we let them in we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shall have matter to make sport of. She gave not over persuading
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them till they said to her, Let them in, and make thou the usual"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,condition with them that they speak not of what concerneth them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not, lest they hear what pleaseth them not. So she rejoiced and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,going to the door presently returned with the three monoculars
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whose beards and mustachios were clean shaven.[FN#168] They
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,salam'd and stood afar off by way of respect; but the three
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ladies rose up to them and welcomed them and wished them joy of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their safe arrival and made them sit down. The Kalandars looked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at the room and saw that it was a pleasant place, clean swept and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,garnished with cowers; and the lamps were burning and the smoke
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of perfumes was spireing in air; and beside the dessert and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fruits and wine, there were three fair girls who might be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"maidens; so they exclaimed with one voice, By Allah, 'tis good!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then they turned to the Porter and saw that he was a merry faced
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wight, albeit he was by no means sober and was sore after his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slappings. So they thought that he was one of themselves and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, A mendicant like us! whether Arab or foreigner.[FN#169]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But when the Porter heard these words, he rose up, and fixing his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eyes fiercely upon them, said, Sit ye here without exceeding in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,talk! Have you not read what is writ over the door? surely it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,befitteth not fellows who come to us like paupers to wag your
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tongues at us. We crave thy pardon, O Fakír,[FN#170] rejoined"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they, and our heads are between thy hands. The ladies laughed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"consumedly at the squabble; and, making peace between the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Kalandars and the Porter, seated the new guests before meat and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they ate. Then they sat together, and the portress served them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with drink; and, as the cup went round merrily, quoth the Porter"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the askers, And you, O brothers mine, have ye no story or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rare adventure to amuse us withal? Now the warmth of wine having
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mounted to their heads they called for musical instruments; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the portress brought them a tambourine of Mosul, and a lute of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Irák, and a Persian harp; and each mendicant took one and tuned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it; this the tambourine and those the lute and the harp, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,struck up a merry tune while the ladies sang so lustily that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there was a great noise.[FN#171] And whilst they were carrying
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on, behold, some one knocked at the gate, and the portress went"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to see what was the matter there. Now the cause of that knocking,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O King (quoth Shahrazad) was this, the Caliph, Harun al-Rashid,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had gone forth from the palace, as was his wont now and then, to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"solace himself in the city that night, and to see and hear what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"new thing was stirring; he was in merchant's gear, and he was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"attended by Ja'afar, his Wazir, and by Masrur his Sworder of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Vengeance.[FN#172] As they walked about the city, their way led"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them towards the house of the three ladies; where they heard the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loud noise of musical instruments and singing and merriment; so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth the Caliph to Ja'afar, I long to enter this house and hear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"those songs and see who sing them. Quoth Ja'afar, O Prince of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Faithful; these folk are surely drunken with wine, and I fear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,some mischief betide us if we get amongst them. There is no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"help but that I go in there, replied the Caliph, and I desire"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee to contrive some pretext for our appearing among them.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ja'afar replied, I hear and I obey;[FN#173] and knocked at the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"door, whereupon the portress came out and opened. Then Ja'afar"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came forward and kissing the ground before her said, O my lady,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,we be merchants from Tiberias town: we arrived at Baghdad ten
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"days ago; and, alighting at the merchants' caravanserai, we sold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all our merchandise. Now a certain trader invited us to an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,entertainment this night; so we went to his house and he set food
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before us and we ate: then we sat at wine and wassail with him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for an hour or so when he gave us leave to depart; and we went
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out from him in the shadow of the night and, being strangers, we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,could not find our way back to our Khan. So haply of your
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kindness and courtesy you will suffer us to tarry with you this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night, and Heaven will reward you![FN#174] The portress looked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon them and seeing them dressed like merchants and men of grave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"looks and solid, she returned to her sisters and repeated to them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ja'afar's story; and they took compassion upon the strangers and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to her, Let them enter. She opened the door to them, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said they to her, Have we thy leave to come in? Come in,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,quoth she; and the Caliph entered followed by Ja'afar and Masrur;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and when the girls saw them they stood up to them in respect and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made them sit down and looked to their wants, saying, Welcome,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and well come and good cheer to the guests, but with one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"condition! What is that? asked they, and one of the ladies"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, Speak not of what concerneth you not, lest ye hear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what pleaseth you not. Even so, said they; and sat down to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their wine and drank deep. Presently the Caliph looked on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"three Kalandars and, seeing them each and every blind of the left"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eye, wondered at the sight; then he gazed upon the girls and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was startled and he marvelled with exceeding marvel at their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,beauty and loveliness. They continued to carouse and to converse
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said to the Caliph, Drink! but he replied, I am vowed to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Pilgrimage;[FN#175] and drew back from the wine. Thereupon the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,portress rose and spreading before him a table cloth worked with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gold, set thereon a porcelain bowl into which she poured willow"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,flower water with a lump of snow and a spoonful of sugar candy.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Caliph thanked her and said in himself,By Allah, I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,recompense her to morrow for the kind deed she hath done. The
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,others again addressed themselves to conversing and carousing;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, when the wine gat the better of them, the eldest lady who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ruled the house rose and making obeisance to them took the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cateress by the hand, and said, Rise, O my sister and let us do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what is our devoir. Both answered Even so! Then the portress
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stood up and proceeded to remove the table service and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,remnants of the banquet; and renewed the pastiles and cleared the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,middle of the saloon. Then she made the Kalandars sit upon a sofa
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at the side of the estrade, and seated the Caliph and Ja'afar and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Masrur on the other side of the saloon; after which she called
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Porter, and said, How scanty is thy courtesy! now thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"no stranger; nay, thou art one of the household. So he stood up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, tightening his waist cloth, asked, What would ye I do? and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she answered, Stand in thy place. Then the procuratrix rose and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"set in the midst of the saloon a low chair and, opening a closet,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried to the Porter, Come help me. So he went to help her and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saw two black bitches with chains round their necks; and she said
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to him, Take hold of them; and he took them and led them into"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the middle of the saloon. Then the lady of the house arose and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tucked up her sleeves above her wrists and, seizing a scourge,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to the Porter, Bring forward one of the bitches. He"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brought her forward, dragging her by the chain, while the bitch"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wept, and shook her head at the lady who, however, came down upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her with blows on the sconce; and the bitch howled and the lady
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ceased not beating her till her forearm failed her. Then, casting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the scourge from her hand, she pressed the bitch to her bosom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, wiping away her tears with her hands, kissed her head. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she said to the Porter, Take her away and bring the second;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, when he brought her, she did with her as she had done with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the first. Now the heart of the Caliph, was touched at these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cruel doings; his chest straitened and he lost all patience in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his desire to know why the two bitches were so beaten. He threw a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wink at Ja'afar wishing him to ask, but; the Minister turning"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"towards him said by signs, Be silent! Then quoth the portress"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the mistress of the house, O my lady, arise and go to thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"place that I in turn may do my devoir.[FN#176] She answered,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Even so; and, taking her seat upon the couch of juniper wood,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pargetted with gold and silver, said to the portress and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cateress, Now do ye what ye have to do. Thereupon the portress"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sat upon a low seat by the couch side; but the procuretrix,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entering a closet, brought out of it a bag of satin with green"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fringes and two tassels of gold. She stood up before the lady of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the house and shaking the bag drew out from it a lute which she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tuned by tightening its pegs; and when it was in perfect order,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she began to sing these quatrains:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ye are the wish, the aim of me *And when, O Love, thy sight I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     see[FN#177]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The heavenly mansion openeth;[FN#178] * But Hell I see when
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     lost thy sight.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"From thee comes madness; nor the less * Comes highest joy,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     comes ecstasy:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nor in my love for thee I fear * Or shame and blame, or hate and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     spite.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When Love was throned within my heart * I rent the veil of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     modesty;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And stints not Love to rend that veil * Garring disgrace on grace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     to alight;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The robe of sickness then I donned * But rent to rags was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     secrecy:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wherefore my love and longing heart * Proclaim your high
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     supremest might;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The tear drop railing adown my cheek * Telleth my tale of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     ignomy:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And all the hid was seen by all * And all my riddle ree'd aright.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Heal then my malady, for thou * Art malady and remedy!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,But she whose cure is in thy hand * Shall ne'er be free of bane
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and blight;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Burn me those eyne that radiance rain * Slay me the swords of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     phantasy;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"How many hath the sword of Love * Laid low, their high degree"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     despite?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Yet will I never cease to pine * Nor to oblivion will I flee.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Love is my health, my faith, my joy * Public and private, wrong"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     or right.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,O happy eyes that sight thy charms * That gaze upon thee at their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     gree!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Yea, of my purest wish and will * The slave of Love I'll aye be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     hight.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the damsel heard this elegy in quatrains she cried out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Alas! Alas! and rent her raiment, and fell to the ground"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fainting; and the Caliph saw scars of the palm rod[FN#179] on her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,back and welts of the whip; and marvelled with exceeding wonder.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then the portress arose and sprinkled water on her and brought
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her a fresh and very fine dress and put it on her. But when the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"company beheld these doings their minds were troubled, for they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had no inkling of the case nor knew the story thereof; so the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Caliph said to Ja'afar, Didst thou not see the scars upon the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,damsel's body? I cannot keep silence or be at rest till I learn
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the truth of her condition and the story of this other maiden and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the secret of the two black bitches. But Ja'afar answered, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"our lord, they made it a condition with us that we speak not of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what concerneth us not, lest we come to hear what pleaseth us"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not. Then said the portress By Allah, O my sister, come to me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and complete this service for me. Replied the procuratrix, With"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,joy and goodly gree; so she took the lute; and leaned it against
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her breasts and swept the strings with her finger tips, and began"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,singing:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Give back mine eyes their sleep long ravished * And say me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     whither be my reason fled:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I learnt that lending to thy love a place * Sleep to mine eyelids
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     mortal foe was made.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"They said, We held thee righteous, who waylaid * Thy soul? Go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     ask his glorious eyes, I said."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I pardon all my blood he pleased to spill * Owning his troubles
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     drove him blood to shed.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,On my mind's mirror sun like sheen he cast * Whose keen
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     reflection fire in vitals bred
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Waters of Life let Allah waste at will * Suffice my wage those
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     lips of dewy red:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,An thou address my love thou'lt find a cause * For plaint and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     tears or ruth or lustihed.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,In water pure his form shall greet your eyne * When fails the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bowl nor need ye drink of wine.[FN#180]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then she quoted from the same ode:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I drank, but the draught of his glance, not wine, * And his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     swaying gait swayed to sleep these eyne:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,'Twas not grape juice grips me but grasp of Past * 'Twas not bowl
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     o'erbowled me but gifts divine:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,His coiling curl-lets my soul ennetted * And his cruel will all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     my wits outwitted.[FN#181]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,After a pause she resumed:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,If we 'plain of absence what shall we say? * Or if pain afflict
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     us where wend our way?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,An I hire a truchman[FN#182] to tell my tale * The lover's plaint
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     is not told for pay:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If I put on patience, a lover's life * After loss of love will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     not last a day:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Naught is left me now but regret, repine * And tears flooding"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     cheeks for ever and aye:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,O thou who the babes of these eyes[FN#183] hast fled * Thou art
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     homed in heart that shall never stray
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Would heaven I wot hast thou kept our pact * Long as stream shall
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     flow, to have firmest fey?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Or hast forgotten the weeping slave * Whom groans afflict and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     whom griefs waylay?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ah, when severance ends and we side by side * Couch, I'll blame"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thy rigours and chide thy pride!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Now when the portress heard her second ode she shrieked aloud and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, By Allah! 'tis right good!; and laying hands on her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"garments tore them, as she did the first time, and fell to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ground fainting. Thereupon the procuratrix rose end brought her a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,second change of clothes after she had sprinkled water on her.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,She recovered and sat upright and said to her sister the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cateress, Onwards, and help me in my duty, for there remains but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this one song. So the provisioneress again brought out the lute
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and began to sing these verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"How long shall last, how long this rigour rife of woe * May not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     suffice thee all these tears thou seest flow?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Our parting thus with purpose fell thou dost prolong * Is't not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     enough to glad the heart of envious foe?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Were but this lying world once true to lover heart * He had not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     watched the weary night in tears of woe:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Oh pity me whom overwhelmed thy cruel will * My lord, my king,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     'tis time some ruth to me thou show:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"To whom reveal my wrongs, O thou who murdered me? * Sad,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     who of broken troth the pangs must undergo!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Increase wild love for thee and phrenzy hour by hour * And days
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     of exile minute by so long, so slow;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O Moslems, claim vendetta[FN#184] for this slave of Love *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Whose sleep Love ever wastes, whose patience Love lays low:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Doth law of Love allow thee, O my wish! to lie * Lapt in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     another's arms and unto me cry Go!?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Yet in thy presence, say, what joys shall I enjoy * When he I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     love but works my love to overthrow?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When the portress heard the third song she cried aloud; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"laying hands on her garments, rent them down to the very skirt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and fell to the ground fainting a third time, again showing the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"scars of the scourge. Then said the three Kalandars, Would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Heaven we had never entered this house, but had rather righted on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the mounds and heaps outside the city! for verily our visit hath
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,been troubled by sights which cut to the heart. The Caliph
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"turned to them and asked, Why so? and they made answer, Our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"minds are sore troubled by this matter. Quoth the Caliph, Are"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ye not of the household? and quoth they, No; nor indeed did we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ever set eyes on the place till within this hour. Hereat the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Caliph marvelled and rejoined, This man who sitteth by you,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would he not know the secret of the matter? and so saying he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,winked and made signs at the Porter. So they questioned the man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but he replied, By the All might of Allah, in love all are"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"alike![FN#185] I am the growth of Baghdad, yet never in my born"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,days did I darken these doors till to day and my companying with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them was a curious matter. By Allah, they rejoined, we took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee for one of them and now we see thou art one like ourselves.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then said the Caliph, We be seven men, and they only three women"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,without even a fourth to help them; so let us question them of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their case; and, if they answer us not, fain we will be answered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,by force. All of them agreed to this except Ja'afar who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said,[FN#186] This is not my recking; let them be; for we are"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their guests and, as ye know, they made a compact and condition"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with us which we accepted and promised to keep: wherefore it is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"better that we be silent concerning this matter; and, as but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"little of the night remaineth, let each and every of us gang his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"own gait. Then he winked at the Caliph and whispered to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,There is but one hour of darkness left and I can bring them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before thee to morrow, when thou canst freely question them all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,concerning their story. But the Caliph raised his head haughtily
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and cried out at him in wrath, saying, I have no patience left"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for my longing to hear of them: let the Kalandars question them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forthright. Quoth Ja'afar, This is not my rede. Then words ran"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"high and talk answered talk, and they disputed as to who should"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"first put the question, but at last all fixed upon the Porter."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And as the jingle increased the house mistress could not but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"notice it and asked them, O ye folk! on what matter are ye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,talking so loudly? Then the Porter stood up respectfully before
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her and said, O my lady, this company earnestly desire that thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,acquaint them with the story of the two bitches and what maketh
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee punish them so cruelly; and then thou fallest to weeping
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,over them and kissing them; and lastly they want to hear the tale
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of thy sister and why she hath been bastinado'd with palm sticks
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like a man. These are the questions they charge me to put, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,peace be with thee.[FN#187] Thereupon quoth she who was the lady
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the house to the guests, Is this true that he saith on your"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"part? and all replied, Yes! save Ja'afar who kept silence."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When she heard these words she cried, By Allah, ye have wronged"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us, O our guests. with grievous wronging; for when you came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before us we made compact and condition with you, that whoso"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,should speak of what concerneth him not should hear what pleaseth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him not. Sufficeth ye not that we took you into our house and fed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,you with our best food? But the fault is not so much yours as
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hers who let you in. Then she tucked up her sleeves from her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wrists and struck the floor thrice with her hand crying, Come ye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,quickly; and lo! a closet door opened and out of it came seven
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"negro slaves with drawn swords in hand to whom she said, Pinion"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me those praters' elbows and bind them each to each. They did
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her bidding and asked her, O veiled and virtuous! is it thy high"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"command that we strike off their heads?; but she answered,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Leave them awhile that I question them of their condition,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before their necks feel the sword. By Allah, O my lady! cried"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Porter, slay me not for other's sin; all these men offended"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and deserve the penalty of crime save myself. Now by Allah, our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,night had been charming had we escaped the mortification of those
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,monocular Kalandars whose entrance into a populous city would
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,convert it into a howling wilderness. Then he repeated these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,verses :
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,How fair is ruth the strong man deigns not smother! * And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fairest fair when shown to weakest brother:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Love's own holy tie between us twain, * Let one not suffer for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     the sin of other.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the Porter ended his verse the lady laughed. And Shahrazad
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                When It was the Eleventh Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the lady,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after laughing at the Porter despite her wrath, came up to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"party and spake thus, Tell me who ye be, for ye have but an hour"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of life; and were ye not men of rank and, perhaps, notables of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"your tribes, you had not been so froward and I had hastened your"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"doom. Then said the Caliph, Woe to thee, O Ja'afar, tell her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who we are lest we be slain by mistake; and speak her fair be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fore some horror befal us. 'Tis part of thy deserts,replied"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he; whereupon the Caliph cried out at him saying, There is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,time for witty words and there is a time for serious work. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the lady accosted the three Kalandars and asked them, Are ye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brothers?; when they answered, No, by Allah, we be naught but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Fakirs and foreigners. Then quoth she to one among them, Wast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou born blind of one eye?; and quoth he, No, by Allah, 'twas"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a marvellous matter and a wondrous mischance which caused my eye
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to be torn out, and mine is a tale which, if it were written upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the eye corners with needle gravers, were a warner to whoso would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be warned.[FN#188] She questioned the second and third Kalandar;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but all replied like the first, By Allah, O our mistress, each"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one of us cometh from a different country, and we are all three"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the sons of Kings, sovereign Princes ruling over suzerains and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"capital cities. Thereupon she turned towards them and said, Let"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,each and every of you tell me his tale in due order and explain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the cause of his coming to our place; and if his story please us
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,let him stroke his head[FN#189] and wend his way. The first to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"come forward was the Hammal, the Porter, who said, O my lady, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"am a man and a porter. This dame, the cateress, hired me to carry"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a load and took me first to the shop of a vintner, then to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,booth of a butcher; thence to the stall of a fruiterer; thence to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a grocer who also sold dry fruits; thence to a confectioner and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perfumer cum druggist and from him to this place where there
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,happened to me with you what happened. Such is my story and peace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be on us all! At this the lady laughed and said, Rub thy head"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and wend thy ways!; but he cried, By Allah, I will not stump it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till I hear the stories of my companions. Then came forward one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the Monoculars and began to tell her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The First Kalandar's Tale.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O my lady, that the cause of my beard being shorn and my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eye being out torn was as follows. My father was a King and he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had a brother who was a King over another city; and it came to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pass that I and my cousin, the son of my paternal uncle, were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,both born on one and the same day. And years and days rolled on;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, as we grew up, I used to visit my uncle every now and then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and to spend a certain number of months with him. Now my cousin
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I were sworn friends; for he ever entreated me with exceeding
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kindness; he killed for me the fattest sheep and strained the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"best of his wines, and we enjoyed long conversing and carousing."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"One day when the wine had gotten the better of us, the son of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"uncle said to me, O my cousin, I have a great service to ask of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee; and I desire that thou stay me not in whatso I desire to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"do! And I replied, With joy and goodly will. Then he made me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,swear the most binding oaths and left me; but after a little
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,while he returned leading a lady veiled and richly apparelled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with ornaments worth a large sum of money. Presently he turned to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me (the woman being still behind him) and said, Take this lady"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with thee and go before me to such a burial ground (describing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it, so that I knew the place), and enter with her into such a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sepulchre[FN#190] and there await my coming. The oaths I swore
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to him made me keep silence and suffered me not to oppose him; so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I led the woman to the cemetery and both I and she took our seats
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in the sepulchre; and hardly had we sat down when in came my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"uncle's son, with a bowl of water, a bag of mortar and an adze"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,somewhat like a hoe. He went straight to the tomb in the midst of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the sepulchre and, breaking it open with the adze set the stones"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on one side; then he fell to digging into the earth of the tomb
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till he came upon a large iron plate, the size of a wicket door;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and on raising it there appeared below it a staircase vaulted and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"winding. Then he turned to the lady and said to her, Come now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and take thy final choice! She at once went down by the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"staircase and disappeared; then quoth he to me, O son of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"uncle, by way of completing thy kindness, when I shall have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"descended into this place, restore the trap door to where it was,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and heap back the earth upon it as it lay before; and then of thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,goodness mix this unslaked lime which is in the bag with this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"water which is in the bowl and, after building up the stones,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,plaster the outside so that none looking upon it shall say:--This
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is a new opening in an old tomb. For a whole year have I worked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at this place whereof none knoweth but Allah, and this is the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"need I have of thee; presently adding, May Allah never bereave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy friends of thee nor make them desolate by thine absence, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son of my uncle, O my dear cousin! And he went down the stairs"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and disappeared for ever. When he was lost to sight I replaced
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the iron plate and did all his bidding till the tomb became as it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was before and I worked almost unconsciously for my head was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heated with wine. Returning to the palace of my uncle, I was told"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that he had gone forth a-sporting and hunting; so I slept that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night without seeing him; and, when the morning dawned, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,remembered the scenes of the past evening and what happened
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,between me and my cousin; I repented of having obeyed him when
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"penitence was of no avail, I still thought, however, that it was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a dream. So I fell to asking for the son of my uncle; but there
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was none to answer me concerning him; and I went out to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grave-yard and the sepulchres, and sought for the tomb under"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which he was, but could not find it; and I ceased not wandering"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"about from sepulchre to sepulchre, and tomb to tomb, all without"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"success, till night set in. So I returned to the city, yet I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,could neither eat nor drink; my thoughts being engrossed with my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cousin, for that I knew not what was become of him; and I grieved"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with exceeding grief and passed another sorrowful night, watching"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"until the morning. Then went I a second time to the cemetery,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pondering over what the son of mine uncle had done; and, sorely"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"repenting my hearkening to him, went round among all the tombs,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but could not find the tomb I sought. I mourned over the past,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and remained in my mourning seven days, seeking the place and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ever missing the path. Then my torture of scruples[FN#191] grew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon me till I well nigh went mad, and I found no way to dispel"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my grief save travel and return to my father. So I set out and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,journeyed homeward; but as I was entering my father's capital a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,crowd of rioters sprang upon me and pinioned me.[FN#192] I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wondered thereat with all wonderment, seeing that I was the son"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the Sultan, and these men were my father's subjects and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,amongst them were some of my own slaves. A great fear fell upon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, and I said to my soul,[FN#193] Would heaven I knew what hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,happened to my father! I questioned those that bound me of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cause of their doing, but they returned me no answer. However,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after a while one of them said to me (and he had been a hired
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"servant of our house), Fortune hath been false to thy father;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his troops betrayed him and the Wazir who slew him now reigneth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in his stead and we lay in wait to seize thee by the bidding of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him. I was well nigh distraught and felt ready to faint on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hearing of my father's death; when they carried me off and placed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me in presence of the usurper. Now between me and him there was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"an olden grudge, the cause of which was this. I was fond of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shooting with the stone bow,[FN#194] and it befel one day as I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was standing on the terrace roof of the palace, that a bird"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lighted on the top of the Wazir's house when he happened to be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there. I shot at the bird and missed the mark; but I hit the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wazir's eye and knocked it out as fate and fortune decreed. Even
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so saith the poet:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,We tread the path where Fate hath led * The path Fate writ we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fain must tread:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And man in one land doomed to die * Death no where else shall do
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     him dead.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And on like wise saith another:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Let Fortune have her wanton way * Take heart and all her words
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     obey:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Nor joy nor mourn at anything * For all things pass and no things
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     stay.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Now when I knocked out the Wazir's eye he could not say a single
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"word, for that my father was King of the city; but he hated me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,everafter and dire was the grudge thus caused between us twain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So when I was set before him hand bound and pinioned, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"straightway gave orders for me to be beheaded. I asked, For what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crime wilt thou put me to death?; whereupon he answered, What"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,crime is greater than this? pointing the while to the place
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"where his eye had been Quoth I, This I did by accident not of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"malice prepense; and quoth he, If thou didst it by accident, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will do the like by thee with intention.''[FN#195] Then cried he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bring him forward, and they brought me up to him, when he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thrust his finger into my left eye and gouged it out; whereupon I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"became one eyed as ye see me. Then he bade bind me hand and foot,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and put me into a chest and said to the sworder, Take charge of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this fellow, and go off with him to the waste lands about the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"city; then draw thy scymitar and slay him, and leave him to feed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the beasts and birds. So the headsman fared forth with me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when he was in the midst of the desert, he took me out of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chest (and I with both hands pinioned and both feet fettered) and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was about to bandage my eyes before striking off my head. But I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wept with exceeding weeping until I made him weep with me and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,looking at him I began to recite these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I deemed you coat o' mail that should withstand * The foeman's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     shafts, and you proved foeman's brand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I hoped your aidance in mine every chance * Though fail my left
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     to aid my dexter hand:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Aloof you stand and hear the railer's gibe * While rain their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     shafts on me the giber-band:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But an ye will not guard me from my foes * Stand clear, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     succour neither these nor those!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And I also quoted:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I deemed my brethren mail of strongest steel * And so they were--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     from foes I to fend my dart!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I deemed their arrows surest of their aim; * And so they were--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     when aiming at my heart!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the headsman heard my lines (he had been sworder to my sire
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he owed me a debt of gratitude) he cried, O my lord, what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"can I do, being but a slave under orders? presently adding, Fly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for thy life and nevermore return to this land, or they will slay"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee and slay me with thee, even as the poet said:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Take thy life and fly whenas evils threat; * Let the ruined house
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     tell its owner's fate:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,New land for the old thou shalt seek and find * But to find new
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     life thou must not await.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Strange that men should sit in the stead of shame, * When Allah's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     world is so wide and great!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And trust not other, in matters grave * Life itself must act for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     a life beset:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ne'er would prowl the lion with maned neck, * Did he reckon on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     aid or of others reck.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hardly believing in my escape, I kissed his hand and thought the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loss of my eye a light matter in consideration of my escaping
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from being slain. I arrived at my uncle's capital; and, going in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to him, told him of what had befallen my father and myself;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereat he wept with sore weeping and said, Verily thou addest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grief to my grief, and woe to my woe; for thy cousin hath been"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"missing these many days; I wot not what hath happened to him, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,none can give me news of him. And he wept till he fainted. I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sorrowed and condoled with him; and he would have applied certain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"medicaments to my eye, but he saw that it was become as a walnut"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with the shell empty. Then said he, O my son, better to lose eye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and keep life! After that I could no longer remain silent about
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my cousin, who was his only son and one dearly loved, so I told"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him all that had happened. He rejoiced with extreme joyance to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hear news of his son and said, Come now and show me the tomb;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but I replied, By Allah, O my uncle, I know not its place,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"though I sought it carefully full many times, yet could not find"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the site. However, I and my uncle went to the grave yard and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"looked right and left, till at last I recognised the tomb and we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,both rejoiced with exceeding joy. We entered the sepulchre and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loosened the earth about the grave; then, up raising the trap"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"door, descended some fifty steps till we came to the foot of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,staircase when lo! we were stopped by a blinding smoke. Thereupon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said my uncle that saying whose sayer shall never come to shame,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"There is no Majesty and there is no Might, save in Allah, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Glorious, the Great! and we advanced till we suddenly came upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a saloon, whose floor was strewed with flour and grain and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,provisions and all manner necessaries; and in the midst of it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stood a canopy sheltering a couch. Thereupon my uncle went up to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the couch and inspecting it found his son and the lady who had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gone down with him into the tomb, lying in each other's embrace;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but the twain had become black as charred wood; it was as if they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had been cast into a pit of fire. When my uncle saw this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spectacle, he spat in his son's face and said, Thou hast thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deserts, O thou hog![FN#196] this is thy judgment in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"transitory world, and yet remaineth the judgment in the world to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"come, a durer and a more enduring -- And Shahrazad perceived the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                 When it was the Twelfth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Kalandar thus went on with his story before the lady and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Caliph and Ja'afar:--My uncle struck his son with his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slipper[FN#197] as he lay there a black heap of coal. I marvelled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at his hardness of heart, and grieving for my cousin and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady, said, By Allah, O my uncle, calm thy wrath: dost thou not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"see that all my thoughts are occupied with this misfortune, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"how sorrowful I am for what hath befallen thy son, and how"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,horrible it is that naught of him remaineth but a black heap of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"charcoal? And is not that enough, but thou must smite him with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy slipper? Answered he,O son of my brother, this youth from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his boyhood was madly in love with his own sister;[FN#198] and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"often and often I forbade him from her, saying to myself:--They"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"are but little ones. However, when they grew up sin befel between"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them; and, although I could hardly believe it, I confined him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chided him and threatened him with the severest threats; and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eunuchs and servants said to him:--Beware of so foul a thing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which none before thee ever did, and which none after thee will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ever do; and have a care lest thou be dishonoured and disgraced
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"among the Kings of the day, even to the end of time. And I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"added:--Such a report as this will be spread abroad by caravans,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and take heed not to give them cause to talk or I will assuredly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,curse thee and do thee to death. After that I lodged them apart
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and shut her up; but the accursed girl loved him with passionate
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"love, for Satan had got the mastery of her as well as of him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made their foul sin seem fair in their sight. Now when my son saw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that I separated them, he secretly built this souterrain and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"furnished it and transported to it victuals, even as thou seest;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, when I had gone out a-sporting, came here with his sister"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and hid from me. Then His righteous judgment fell upon the twain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and consumed them with fire from Heaven; and verily the last
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,judgment will deal them durer pains and more enduring! Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wept and I wept with him; and he looked at me and said, Thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my son in his stead. And I bethought me awhile of the world and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of its chances, how the Wazir had slain my father and had taken"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his place and had put out my eye; and how my cousin had come to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his death by the strangest chance: and I wept again and my uncle
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wept with me. Then we mounted the steps and let down the iron
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"plate and heaped up the earth over it; and, after restoring the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tomb to its former condition, we returned to the palace. But"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hardly had we sat down ere we heard the tomtoming of the kettle
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drum and tantara of trumpets and clash of cymbals; and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rattling of war men's lances; and the clamours of assailants and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the clanking of bits and the neighing of steeds; while the world
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was canopied with dense dust and sand clouds raised by the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"horses' hoofs.[FN#199] We were amazed at sight and sound, knowing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not what could be the matter; so we asked and were told us that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Wazir who usurped my father's kingdom had marched his men;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and that after levying his soldiery and taking a host of wild
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Arabs[FN#200] into service, he had come down upon us with armies"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,like the sands of the sea; their number none could tell and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,against them none could prevail. They attacked the city unawares;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the citizens, being powerless to oppose them, surrendered the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,place: my uncle was slain and I made for the suburbs saying to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"myself, If thou fall into this villain's hands he will assuredly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kill thee. On this wise all my troubles were renewed; and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pondered all that had betided my father and my uncle and I knew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not what to do; for if the city people or my father's troops had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,recognised me they would have done their best to win favour by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,destroying me; and I could think of no way to escape save by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shaving off my beard and my eyebrows. So I shore them off and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"changing my fine clothes for a Kalandar's rags, I fared forth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from my uncle's capital and made for this city; hoping that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,peradventure some one would assist me to the presence of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Prince of the Faithful,[FN#201] and the Caliph who is the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Viceregent of Allah upon earth. Thus have I come hither that I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,might tell him my tale and lay my case before him. I arrived here
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this very night, and was standing in doubt whither I should go,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when suddenly I saw this second Kalandar; so I salam'd to him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saying--I am a stranger! and he answered:--I too am a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stranger! And as we were conversing behold, up came our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"companion, this third Kalandar, and saluted us saying:--I am a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stranger! And we answered:--We too be strangers! Then we three
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,walked on and together till darkness overtook us and Destiny
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crave us to your house. Such, then, is the cause of the shaving"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of my beard and mustachios and eyebrows; and the manner of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,losing my right eye. They marvelled much at this tale and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Caliph said to Ja'afar, By Allah, I have not seen nor have I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heard the like of what hath happened to this Kalandar! Quoth the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady of the house, Rub thy head and wend thy ways; but he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, I will not go, till I hear the history of the two"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"others. Thereupon the second Kalandar came forward; and, kissing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the ground, began to tell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Second Kalandar's Tale.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O my lady, that I was not born one eyed and mine is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,strange story; an it were graven with needle graver on the eye
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"corners, it were a warner to whoso would be warned. I am a King,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son of a King, and was brought up like a Prince. I learned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,intoning the Koran according the seven schools;[FN#202] and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"read all manner books, and held disputations on their contents"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with the doctors and men of science; moreover I studied star lore
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the fair sayings of poets and I exercised myself in all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,branches of learning until I surpassed the people of my time; my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,skill in calligraphy exceeded that of all the scribes; and my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fame was bruited abroad over all climes and cities, and all the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kings learned to know my name. Amongst others the King of Hind
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard of me and sent to my father to invite me to his court, with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,offerings and presents and rarities such as befit royalties. So
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my father fitted out six ships for me and my people; and we put
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to sea and sailed for the space of a full month till we made the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,land. Then we brought out the horses that were with us in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ships; and, after loading the camels with our presents for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Prince, we set forth inland. But we had marched only a little"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"way, when behold, a dust cloud up flew, and grew until it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,walled[FN#203] the horizon from view. After an hour or so the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"veil lifted and discovered beneath it fifty horsemen, ravening"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lions to the sight, in steel armour dight. We observed them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"straightly and lo! they were cutters off of the highway, wild as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wild Arabs. When they saw that we were only four and had with us
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but the ten camels carrying the presents, they dashed down upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us with lances at rest. We signed to them, with our fingers, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it were saying, We be messengers of the great King of Hind, so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"harm us not! but they answered on like wise, We are not in his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dominions to obey nor are we subject to his sway. Then they set
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon us and slew some of my slaves and put the lave to flight;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I also fled after I had gotten a wound, a grievous hurt,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whilst the Arabs were taken up with the money and the presents
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which were with us. I went forth unknowing whither I went, having"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,become mean as I was mighty; and I fared on until I came to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,crest of a mountain where I took shelter for the night in a cave.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When day arose I set out again, nor ceased after this fashion"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till I arrived at a fair city and a well filled. Now it was the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,season when Winter was turning away with his rime and to greet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the world with his flowers came Prime, and the young blooms were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"springing and the streams flowed ringing, and the birds were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sweetly singing, as saith the poet concerning a certain city when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,describing it:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,A place secure from every thought of fear * Safety and peace for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     ever lord it here:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Its beauties seem to beautify its sons * And as in Heaven its
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     happy folk appear.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I was glad of my arrival for I was wearied with the way, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,yellow of face for weakness and want; but my plight was pitiable
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I knew not whither to betake me. So I accosted a Tailor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sitting in his little shop and saluted him; he returned my salam,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and bade me kindly welcome and wished me well and entreated me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gently and asked me of the cause of my strangerhood. I told him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all my past from first to last; and he was concerned on my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"account and said, O youth, disclose not thy secret to any: the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King of this city is the greatest enemy thy father hath, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there is blood wit[FN#204] between them and thou hast cause to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fear for thy life. Then he set meat and drink before me; and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ate and drank and he with me; and we conversed freely till night
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fall, when he cleared me a place in a corner of his shop and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brought me a carpet and a coverlet. I tarried with him three
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"days; at the end of which time he said to me, Knowest thou no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"calling whereby to win thy living, O my son? I am learned in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the law, I replied, and a doctor of doctrine; an adept in art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and science, a mathematician and a notable penman. He rejoined,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thy calling is of no account in our city, where not a soul under"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,standeth science or even writing or aught save money making.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then said I, By Allah, I know nothing but what I have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mentioned; and he answered, Gird thy middle and take thee a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hatchet and a cord, and go and hew wood in the wold for thy daily"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bread, till Allah send thee relief; and tell none who thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lest they slay thee. Then he bought me an axe and a rope and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gave me in charge to certain wood cutters; and with these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"guardians I went forth into the forest, where I cut fuel wood the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whole of my day and came back in the evening bearing my bundle on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my head. I sold it for half a diner, with part of which I bought"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,provision and laid by the rest. In such work I spent a whole year
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and when this was ended I went out one day, as was my wont, into"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the wilderness; and, wandering away from my companions, I chanced"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on a thickly grown lowland[FN#205] in which there was an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,abundance of wood. So I entered and I found the gnarled stump of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a great tree and loosened the ground about it and shovelled away
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the earth. Presently my hatchet rang upon a copper ring; so I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cleared away the soil and behold, the ring was attached to a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wooden trap door. This I raised and there appeared beneath it a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,staircase. I descended the steps to the bottom and came to a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"door, which I opened and found myself in a noble hall strong of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"structure and beautifully built, where was a damsel like a pearl"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of great price, whose favour banished from my heart all grief and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cark and care; and whose soft speech healed the soul in despair
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and captivated the wise and ware. Her figure measured five feet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in height; her breasts were firm and upright; her cheek a very
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,garden of delight; her colour lively bright; her face gleamed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like dawn through curly tresses which gloomed like night, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,above the snows of her bosom glittered teeth of a pearly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,white.[FN#206] As the poet said of one like her:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Slim waisted loveling jetty hair encrowned * A wand of willow on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     a sandy mound:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And as saith another.--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Four things that meet not, save they here unite * To shed my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     heart blood and to rape my sprite:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Brilliantest forehead; tresses jetty bright; * Cheeks rosy red
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and stature beauty dight.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When I looked upon her I prostrated myself before Him who had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"created her, for the beauty and loveliness He had shaped in her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she looked at me and said, Art thou man or Jinni? I am a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man, answered I, and she, Now who brought thee to this place"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where I have abided five and twenty years without even yet seeing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man in it? Quoth I (and indeed I found her words wonder sweet,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and my heart was melted to the core by them), O my lady, my good"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fortune led me hither for the dispelling of my cark and care.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then I related to her all my mishap from first to last, and my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"case appeared to her exceeding grievous; so she wept and said, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will tell thee my story in my turn. I am the daughter of the King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ifitamus, lord of the Islands of Abnus,[FN#207] who married me to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my cousin, the son of my paternal uncle; but on my wedding night"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"an Ifrit named Jirjís[FN#208] bin Rajmús, first cousin that is,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mother's sister's son, of Iblís, the Foul Fiend, snatched me up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, flying away with me like a bird, set me down in this place,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whither he conveyed all I needed of fine stuffs, raiment and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"jewels and furniture, and meat and drink and other else. Once in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"every ten days he comes here and lies a single night with me, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"then wends his way, for he took me without the consent of his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,family; and he hath agreed with me that if ever I need him by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night or by day, I have only to pass my hand over yonder two"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lines engraved upon the alcove, and he will appear to me before"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my fingers cease touching. Four days have now passed since he was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"here; and, as there remain six days before he come again, say me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wilt thou abide with me five days, and go hence the day before"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his coming? I replied Yes, and yes again! O rare, if all this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be not a dream! Hereat she was glad and, springing to her feet,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seized my hand and carried me through an arched doorway to a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hammam bath, a fair hall and richly decorate. I doffed my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clothes, and she doffed hers; then we bathed and she washed me;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and when this was done we left the bath, and she seated me by her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"side upon a high divan, and brought me sherbet scented with musk."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When we felt cool after the bath, she set food before me and we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ate and fell to talking; but presently she said to me, Lay thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"down and take thy rest, for surely thou must be weary. So I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thanked her, my lady, and lay down and slept soundly, forgetting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all that had happened to me. When I awoke I found her rubbing and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shampooing my feet;[FN#209] so I again thanked her and blessed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her and we sat for awhile talking. Said she, By Allah, I was sad"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at heart, for that I have dwelt alone underground for these five"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and twenty years; and praise be to Allah, who hath sent me some"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one with whom I can converse! Then she asked, O youth, what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sayest thou to wine? and I answered, Do as thou wilt. Where-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon she went to a cupboard and took out a sealed flask of right
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,old wine and set off the table with flowers and scented herbs and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,began to sing these lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Had we known of thy coming we fain had dispread * The cores of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     our hearts or the balls of our eyes;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Our cheeks as a carpet to greet thee had thrown * And our eyelids
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     had strown for thy feet to betread.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy," Now when she finished her verse I thanked her, for indeed love"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of her had gotten hold of my heart and my grief and anguish were
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gone. We sat at converse and carousel till nightfall, and with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her I spent the night--such night never spent I in all my life!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"On the morrow delight followed delight till midday, by which time"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I had drunken wine so freely that I had lost my wits, and stood"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"up, staggering to the right and to the left, and said Come, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"charmer, and I will carry thee up from this underground vault and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,deliver thee from the spell of thy Jinni. She laughed and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,replied Content thee and hold thy peace: of every ten days one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is for the Ifrit and the other nine are thine. Quoth I (and in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"good sooth drink had got the better of me), This very instant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will I break down the alcove whereon is graven the talisman and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"summon the Ifrit that I may slay him, for it is a practice of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mine to slay Ifrits! When she heard my words her colour waxed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wan and she said, By Allah, do not! and she began repeating:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,This is a thing wherein destruction lies * I rede thee shun it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     an thy wits be wise.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And these also:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O thou who seekest severance, draw the rein * Of thy swift steed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     nor seek o'ermuch t' advance;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ah stay! for treachery is the rule of life, * And sweets of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     meeting end in severance.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I heard her verse but paid no heed to her words, nay, I raised my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,foot and administered to the alcove a mighty kick. And Shahrazad
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permisted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"               When it was the Thirteenth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the second"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Kalandar thus continued his tale to the lady:--But when, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mistress, I kicked that alcove with a mighty kick, behold, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,air starkened and darkened and thundered and lightened; the earth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,trembled and quaked and the world became invisible. At once the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fumes of wine left my head: I cried to her, What is the matter?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she replied, The Ifrit is upon us! did I not warn thee of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this? By Allah, thou hast brought ruin upon me; but fly for thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,life and go up by the way thou camest down! So I fled up the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"staircase; but, in the excess of my fear, I forgot sandals and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hatchet. And when I had mounted two steps I turned to look for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them, and lo! I saw the earth cleave asunder, and there arose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from it an Ifrit, a monster of hideousness, who said to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,damsel What trouble and posher be this wherewith thou disturbest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me? What mishap hath betided thee? No mishap hath befallen me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she answered, save that my breast was straitened[FN#210] and my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heart heavy with sadness! so I drank a little wine to broaden it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and to hearten myself; then I rose to obey a call of Nature, but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the wine had gotten into my head and I fell against the alcove.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou liest, like the whore thou art! shrieked the Ifrit; and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,looked around the hall right and left till he caught sight of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"axe and sandals and said to her, What be these but the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,belongings of some mortal who hath been in thy society? She
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, I never set eyes upon them till this moment: they must"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have been brought by thee hither cleaving to thy garments. Quoth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Ifrit, These words are absurd; thou harlot! thou strumpet!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he stripped her stark naked and, stretching her upon the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"floor, bound her hands and feet to four stakes, like one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,crucified;[FN#211] and set about torturing and trying to make her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,confess. I could not bear to stand listening to her cries and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,groans; so I climbed the stair on the quake with fear; and when I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,reached the top I replaced the trap door and covered it with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,earth. Then repented I of what I had done with penitence
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding; and thought of the lady and her beauty and loveliness,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the tortures she was suffering at the hands of the accursed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ifrit, after her quiet life of five and twenty years; and how all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that had happened to her was for the cause of me. I bethought me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of my father and his kingly estate and how I had become a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"woodcutter; and how, after my time had been awhile serene, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,world had again waxed turbid and troubled to me. So I wept
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bitterly and repeated this couplet:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy, What time Fate's tyranny shall most oppress thee * Perpend! one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     day shall joy thee, one distress thee!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then I walked till I reached the home of my friend, the Tailor,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whom I found most anxiously expecting me; indeed he was, as the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying goes, on coals of fire for my account. And when he saw me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he said, All night long my heart hath been heavy, fearing for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee from wild beasts or other mischances. Now praise be to Allah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for thy safety! I thanked him for his friendly solicitude and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"retiring to my corner, sat pondering and musing on what had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,befallen me; and I blamed and chided myself for my meddlesome
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,folly and my frowardness in kicking the alcove. I was calling
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"myself to account when behold, my friend, the Tailor, came to me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, O youth, in the shop there is an old man, a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Persian,[FN#212] who seeketh thee: he hath thy hatchet and thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sandals which he had taken to the woodcutters,[FN#213] saying, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was going out at what time the Mu'azzin began the call to dawn
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prayer, when I chanced upon these things and know not whose they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,are; so direct me to their owner. The woodcutters recognised thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hatchet and directed him to thee: he is sitting in my shop, so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fare forth to him and thank him and take thine axe and sandals.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When I heard these words I turned yellow with fear and felt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stunned as by a blow; and, before I could recover myself, lo! the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"floor of my private room clove asunder, and out of it rose the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Persian who was the Ifrit. He had tortured the lady with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding tortures, natheless she would not confess to him aught;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so he took the hatchet and sandals and said to her, As surely as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I am Jirjis of the seed of Iblis, I will bring thee back the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,owner of this and these![FN#214] Then he went to the woodcutters
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with the presence aforesaid and, being directed to me, after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waiting a while in the shop till the fact was confirmed, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,suddenly snatched me up as a hawk snatcheth a mouse and dew high
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in air; but presently descended and plunged with me under the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"earth (I being aswoon the while), and lastly set me down in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,subterranean palace wherein I had passed that blissful night. And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there I saw the lady stripped to the skin, her limbs bound to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,four stakes and blood welling from her sides. At the sight my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eyes ran over with tears; but the Ifrit covered her person and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, O wanton, is not this man thy lover? She looked upon me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and replied, I wot him not nor have I ever seen him before this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hour! Quoth the Ifrit, What! this torture and yet no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"confessing; and quoth she,I never saw this man in my born days,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and it is not lawful in Allah's sight to tell lies on him. If
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou know him not, said the Ifrit to her, take this sword and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,strike off his head.''[FN#215] She hent the sword in hand and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came close up to me; and I signalled to her with my eyebrows, my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tears the while flowing adown my cheeks. She understood me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made answer, also by signs, How couldest thou bring all this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"evil upon me? and I rejoined after the same fashion, This is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the time for mercy and forgiveness. And the mute tongue of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,case[FN#216] spake aloud saying:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Mine eyes were dragomans for my tongue betted * And told full
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     clear the love I fain would hide:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When last we met and tears in torrents railed * For tongue struck
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     dumb my glances testified:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,She signed with eye glance while her lips were mute * I signed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     with fingers and she kenned th' implied:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Our eyebrows did all duty 'twixt us twain; * And we being
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     speechless Love spake loud and plain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then, O my mistress, the lady threw away the sword and said, How"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shall I strike the neck of one I wot not, and who hath done me no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,evil? Such deed were not lawful in my law! and she held her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hand. Said the Ifrit, 'Tis grievous to thee to slay thy lover;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, because he hath lain with thee, thou endurest these torments"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and obstinately refusest to confess. After this it is clear to me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that only like loveth and pitieth like. Then he turned to me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asked me, O man, haply thou also dost not know this woman;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereto I answered, And pray who may she be? assuredly I never"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw her till this instant. Then take the sword, said he and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,strike off her head and I will believe that thou wottest her not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and will leave thee free to go, and will not deaf 'hardly with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee. I replied, That will I do; and, taking the sword went"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forward sharply and raised my hand to smite. But she signed to me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with her eyebrows, Have I failed thee in aught of love; and is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it thus that thou requirest me? I understood what her looks
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"implied and answered her with an eye-glance, I will sacrifice my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,soul for thee. And the tongue of the case wrote in our hearts
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"How many a lover with his eyebrows speaketh * To his beloved, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     his passion pleadeth:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,With flashing eyne his passion he inspireth * And well she seeth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     what kits pleading needeth.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,How sweet the look when each on other gazeth; * And with what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     swiftness and how sure it speedeth:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And this with eyebrows all his passion writeth; * And that with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     eyeballs all his passion readeth.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then my eyes filled with tears to overflowing and I cast the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sword from my hand saying, O mighty Ifrit and hero, if a woman"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lacking wits and faith deem it unlawful to strike off my head,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"how can it be lawful for me, a man, to smite her neck whom I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,never saw in my whole life. I cannot do such misdeed though thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cause me drink the cup of death and perdition. Then said the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ifrit, Ye twain show the good understanding between you; but I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will let you see how such doings end. He took the sword, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"struck off the lady's hands first, with four strokes, and then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her feet; whilst I looked on and made sure of death and she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"farewelled me with her dying eyes. So the Ifrit cried at her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thou whorest and makest me a wittol with thine eyes; and struck
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her so that her head went flying. Then he turned to me and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O mortal, we have it in our law that, when the wife committeth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,advowtry it is lawful for us to slay her. As for this damsel I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,snatched her away on her bride-night when she was a girl of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,twelve and she knew no one but myself. I used to come to her once
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"every ten days and lie with her the night, under the semblance of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a man, a Persian; and when I was well assured that she had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cuckolded me, I slew her. But as for thee I am not well satisfied"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that thou hast wronged me in her; nevertheless I must not let
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee go unharmed; so ask a boon of me and I will grant it. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I rejoiced, O my lady, with ex ceeding joy and said, What boon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shall I crave of thee? He replied, Ask me this boon; into what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shape I shall bewitch thee; wilt thou be a dog, or an ass or an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ape? I rejoined (and indeed I had hoped that mercy might be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shown me), By Allah, spare me, that Allah spare thee for sparing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a Moslem and a man who never wronged thee. And I humbled myself
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before him with exceeding humility, and remained standing in his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"presence, saying, I am sore oppressed by circumstance. He"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied Talk me no long talk, it is in my power to slay thee;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but I give thee instead thy choice. Quoth I, O thou Ifrit, it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would besit thee to pardon me even as the Envied pardoned the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Envier. Quoth he, And how was that? and I began to tell him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Tale of the Envier and the Envied.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"They relate, O Ifrit, that in a certain city were two men who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dwelt in adjoining houses, having a common party wall; and one of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them envied the other and looked on him with an evil eye,[FN#217]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and did his utmost endeavour to injure him; and, albeit at all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"times he was jealous of his neighbour, his malice at last grew on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him till he could hardly eat or enjoy the sweet pleasures of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sleep. But the Envied did nothing save prosper; and the more the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"other strove to injure him, the more he got and gained and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,throve. At last the malice of his neighbour and the man's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,constant endeavour to work him a harm came to his knowledge; so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he said, By Allah! God's earth is wide enough for its people;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, leaving the neighbourhood, he repaired to another city where"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he bought himself a piece of land in which was a dried up draw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"well,[FN#218] old and in ruinous condition. Here he built him an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"oratory and, furnishing it with a few necessaries, took up his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"abode therein, and devoted himself to prayer and worshipping"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah Almighty; and Fakirs and holy mendicants docked to him from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all quarters; and his fame went abroad through the city and that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"country side. Presently the news reached his envious neighbour,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of what good fortune had befallen him and how the city notables
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had become his disciples; so he travelled to the place and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"presented himself at the holy man's hermitage, and was met by the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Envied with welcome and greeting and all honour. Then quoth the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Envier, I have a word to say to thee; and this is the cause of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my faring hither, and I wish to give thee a piece of good news;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so come with me to thy cell. Thereupon the Envied arose and took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Envier by the hand, and they went in to the inmost part of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the hermitage; but the Envier said, Bid thy Fakirs retire to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their cells, for I will not tell thee what I have to say, save in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,secret where none may hear us. Accordingly the Envied said to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his Fakirs, Retire to your private cells; and, when all had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"done as he bade them, he set out with his visitor and walked a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,little way until the twain reached the ruinous old well. And as
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they stood upon the brink the Envier gave the Envied a push which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tumbled him headlong into it, unseen of any; whereupon he fared"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forth, and went his ways, thinking to have had slain him. Now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this well happened to be haunted by the Jann who, seeing the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"case, bore him up and let him down little by little, till he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reached the bottom, when they seated him upon a large stone. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one of them asked his fellows, Wot ye who be this man? and they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, Nay. This man, continued the speaker, is the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Envied hight who, flying from the Envier, came to dwell in our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"city, and here founded this holy house, and he hath edified us by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his litanies[FN#219] and his lections of the Koran; but the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Envier set out and journeyed till he rejoined him, and cunningly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,contrived to deceive him and cast him into the well where we now
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,are. But the fame of this good man hath this very night come to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Sultan of our city who designeth to visit him on the morrow
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on account of his daughter. What aileth his daughter? asked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one, and another answered She is possessed of a spirit; for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Maymun, son of Damdam, is madly in love with her; but, if this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pious man knew the remedy, her cure would be as easy as could"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be. Hereupon one of them inquired, And what is the medicine?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he replied, The black tom cat which is with him in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"oratory hath, on the end of his tail, a white spot, the size of a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dirham; let him pluck seven white hairs from the spot, then let"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him fumigate her therewith and the Marid will flee from her and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not return; so she shall be sane for the rest of her life. All
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this took place, O Ifrit, within earshot of the Envied who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,listened readily. When dawn broke and morn arose in sheen and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shone, the Fakirs went to seek the Shaykh and found him climbing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up the wall of the well; whereby he was magnified in their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eyes.[FN#220] Then, knowing that naught save the black tomcat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"could supply him with the remedy required, he plucked the seven"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tail hairs from the white spot and laid them by him; and hardly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had the sun risen ere the Sultan entered the hermitage, with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"great lords of his estate, bidding the rest of his retinue to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"remain standing outside. The Envied gave him a hearty welcome,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and seating him by his side asked him, Shall I tell thee the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cause of thy coming? The King answered, Yes. He continued,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thou hast come upon pretext of a visitation;[FN#221] but it is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in thy heart to question me of thy daughter. Replied the King, "
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tis even so, O thou holy Shaykh; and the Envied continued,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Send and fetch her, and I trust to heal her forthright (an such"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it be the will of Allah!) The King in great joy sent for his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter, and they brought her pinioned and fettered. The Envied"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made her sit down behind a curtain and taking out the hairs
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fumigated her therewith; whereupon that which was in her head
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cried out and departed from her. The girl was at once restored to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her right mind and veiling her face, said, What hath happened"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and who brought me hither? The Sultan rejoiced with a joy that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nothing could exceed, and kissed his daughter's eyes,[FN#222] and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the holy man's hand; then, turning to his great lords, he asked,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,How say ye! What fee deserveth he who hath made my daughter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whole? and all answered, He deserveth her to wife; and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King said, Ye speak sooth! So he married him to her and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Envied thus became son in law to the King. And after a little the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir died and the King said, Whom can I make Minister in his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stead? Thy son in law, replied the courtiers. So the Envied"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,became a Wazir; and after a while the Sultan also died and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lieges said, Whom shall we make King? and all cried, The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir. So the Wazir was forthright made Sultan, and he became"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King regnant, a true ruler of men. One day as he had mounted his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"horse; and, in the eminence of his kinglihood, was riding amidst"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his Emirs and Wazirs and the Grandees of his realm his eye fell
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon his old neighbour, the Envier, who stood afoot on his path;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so he turned to one of his Ministers, and said, Bring hither"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that man and cause him no affright. The Wazir brought him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King said, Give him a thousand miskals[FN#223] of gold from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the treasury, and load him ten camels with goods for trade, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,send him under escort to his own town. Then he bade his enemy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,farewell and sent him away and forbore to punish him for the many
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and great evils he had done. See, O Ifrit, the mercy of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Envied to the Envier, who had hated him from the beginning and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had borne him such bitter malice and never met him without
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"causing him trouble; and had driven him from house and home, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,then had journeyed for the sole purpose of taking his life by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,throwing him into the well. Yet he did not requite his injurious
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dealing, but forgave him and was bountiful to him.[FN#224] Then I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wept before him, O my lady, with sore weeping, never was there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sorer, and I recited:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Pardon my fault, for 'tis the wise man's wont * All faults to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pardon and revenge forgo:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,In sooth all manner faults in me contain * Then deign of goodness
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     mercy grace to show:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Whoso imploreth pardon from on High * Should hold his hand
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     from sinners here below.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Said the Ifrit, Lengthen not thy words! As to my slaying thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fear it not, and as to my pardoning thee hope it not; but from my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bewitching thee there is no escape. Then he tore me from the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ground which closed under my feet and hew with me into the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,firmament till I saw the earth as a large white cloud or a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saucer[FN#225] in the midst of the waters. Presently he set me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"down on a mountain, and taking a little dust, over which he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"muttered some magical words, sprinkled me therewith, saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Quit that shape and take thou the shape of an ape! And on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"instant I became an ape, a tailless baboon, the son of a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,century[FN#226]. Now when he had left me and I saw myself in this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ugly and hateful shape, I wept for myself, but resigned my soul"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the tyranny of Time and Circumstance, well weeting that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Fortune is fair and constant to no man. I descended the mountain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and found at the foot a desert plain, long and broad, over which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I travelled for the space of a month till my course brought me to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the brink of the briny sea.[FN#227] After standing there awhile,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I was ware of a ship in the offing which ran before a fair wind
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,making for the shore. I hid myself behind a rock on the beach and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waited till the ship drew near, when I leaped on board. I found"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her full of merchants and passengers and one of them cried, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Captain, this ill omened brute will bring us ill luck! and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"another said, Turn this ill omened beast out from among us; the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Captain said, Let us kill it! another said, Slay it with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sword; a third, Drown it; and a fourth, Shoot it with an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,arrow. But I sprang up and laid hold of the Rais's[FN#228]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"skirt, and shed tears which poured down my chops. The Captain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"took pity on me, and said, O merchants! this ape hath appealed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to me for protection and I will protect him; henceforth he is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"under my charge: so let none do him aught hurt or harm, otherwise"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there will be bad blood between us. Then he entreated me kindly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and whatsoever he said I understood and ministered to his every
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"want and served him as a servant, albeit my tongue would not obey"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my wishes; so that he came to love me. The vessel sailed on, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wind being fair, for the space of fifty days; at the end of which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,we cast anchor under the walls of a great city wherein was a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"world of people, especially learned men, none could tell their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,number save Allah. No sooner had we arrived than we were visited
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"by certain Mameluke officials from the King of that city; who,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after boarding us, greeted the merchants and giving them joy of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"safe arrival said, Our King welcometh you, and sendeth you this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"roll of paper, whereupon each and every of you must write a line."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"For ye shall know that the King's Minister, a calligrapher of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"renown, is dead, and the King hath sworn a solemn oath that he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will make none Wazir in his stead who cannot write as well as he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,could. He then gave us the scroll which measured ten cubits long
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"by a breadth of one, and each of the merchants who knew how to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"write wrote a line thereon, even to the last of them; after which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I stood up (still in the shape of an ape) and snatched the roll
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out of their hands. They feared lest I should tear it or throw it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"overboard; so they tried to stay me and scare me, but I signed to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them that i could write, whereat all marvelled, saying, We never"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yet saw an, ape write. And the Captain cried, Let him write;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and if he scribble and scrabble we will kick him out and kill
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him; but if he; write fair and scholarly I will adopt him as my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,son; for surely I never yet saw a more intelligent and well
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mannered monkey than he. Would Heaven my real son were his match
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in morals and manners. I took the reed, and stretching out my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"paw, dipped it in ink and wrote, in the hand used for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"letters,[FN#229] these two couplets:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Time hath recorded gifts she gave the great; * But none recorded
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thine which be far higher
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah ne'er orphan men by loss of thee * Who be of Goodness
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     mother. Bounty's sire.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And I wrote in Rayháni or larger letters elegantly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,curved[FN#230]:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou hast a reed[FN#231] of rede to every land, * Whose driving"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     causeth all the world to thrive;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Nil is the Nile of Misraim by thy boons * Who makest misery
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     smile with fingers five
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then I wrote in the Suls[FN#232] character:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"There be no writer who from Death shall fleet, * But what his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     hand hath writ men shall repeat:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Write, therefore, naught save what shall serve thee when * Thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     see's on Judgment-Day an so thou see's!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then I wrote in the character Naskh[FN#233]:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When to sore parting Fate our love shall doom, * To distant life"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     by Destiny decreed,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"We cause the inkhorn's lips to 'plain our pains, * And tongue our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     utterance with the talking reed.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And I wrote in the Túmár character[FN#234]:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Kingdom with none endures; if thou deny * This truth, where be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     the Kings of earlier earth?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Set trees of goodliness while rule endures, * And when thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fallen they shall tell thy worth.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And I wrote in the character Muhakkak[FN#235]:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When oped the inkhorn of thy wealth and fame * Take ink of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     generous heart and gracious hand;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Write brave and noble deeds while write thou can * And win thee
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     praise from point of pen and brand.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then I gave the scroll to the officials and, after we all had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"written our line, they carried it before the King. When he saw"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the paper no writing pleased him save my writing; and he said to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the assembled courtiers, Go seek the writer of these lines and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dress him in a splendid robe of honour; then mount him on a she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mule,[FN#236] let a band of music precede him and bring him to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the presence. At these words they smiled and the King was wroth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with them and cried, O accursed! I give you an order and you"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"laugh at me? O King, replied they, if we laugh 'tis not at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee and not without a cause. And what is it? asked he; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they answered, O King, thou orderest us to bring to thy presence"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the man who wrote these lines; now the truth is that he who wrote
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them is not of the sons of Adam,[FN#237] but an ape, a tail-less"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"baboon, belonging to the ship captain. Quoth he, Is this true"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that you say? Quoth they, Yea! by the rights of thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,munificence! The King marvelled at their words and shook with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mirth and said, I am minded to buy this ape of the Captain."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he sent messengers to the ship with the mule, the dress, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"guard and the state drums, saying, Not the less do you clothe"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him in the robe of honour and mount him on the mule and let him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be surrounded by the guards and preceded by the band of music.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,They came to the ship and took me from the Captain and robed me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in the robe of honour and, mounting me on the she mule, carried"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me in state procession through the streets', whilst the people"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"were amazed and amused. And folk said to one another, Halloo! is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,our Sultan about to make an ape his Minister?; and came all agog
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crowding to gaze at me, and the town was astir and turned topsy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,turvy on my account. When they brought me up to the King and set
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me in his presence, I kissed the ground before him three times,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and once before the High Chamberlain and great officers, and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bade me be seated, and I sat respectfully on shins and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"knees,[FN#238] and all who were present marvelled at my fine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"manners, and the King most of all. Thereupon he ordered the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lieges to retire; and, when none remained save the King's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"majesty, the Eunuch on duty and a little white slave, he bade"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them set before me the table of food, containing all manner of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"birds, whatever hoppeth and flieth and treadeth in nest, such as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,quail and sand grouse. Then he signed me to eat with him; so I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rose and kissed ground before him, then sat me down and ate with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him. And when the table was removed I washed my hands in seven
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,waters and took the reed-case and reed; and wrote instead of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,speaking these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wail for the little partridges on porringer and plate; * Cry for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     the ruin of the fries and stews well marinate:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Keen as I keen for loved, lost daughters of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Katá-grouse,[FN#239] * And omelette round the fair"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     enbrowned fowls agglomerate:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O fire in heart of me for fish, those deux poissons I saw, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Bedded on new made scones[FN#240] and cakes in piles to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     laniate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"For thee, O vermicelli! aches my very maw! I hold * Without thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     every taste and joy are clean annihilate
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Those eggs have rolled their yellow eyes in torturing pains of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     fire * Ere served with hash and fritters hot, that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     delicatest cate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Praised be Allah for His baked and roast and ah! how good * This
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     pulse, these pot-herbs steeped in oil with eysill combinate!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When hunger sated was, I elbow-propt fell back upon * Meat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pudding[FN#241] wherein gleamed the bangles that my wits
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     amate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then woke I sleeping appetite to eat as though in sport * Sweets
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     from broceded trays and kickshaws most elaborate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Be patient, soul of me! Time is a haughty, jealous wight; * Today"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     he seems dark-lowering and tomorrow fair to sight.[FN#242]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then I rose and seated myself at a respectful distance while the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King read what I had written, and marvelled, exclaiming, O the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"miracle, that an ape should be gifted with this graceful style"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and this power of penmanship! By Allah, 'tis a wonder of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wonders! Presently they set before the King choice wines in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,flagons of glass and he drank: then he passed on the cup to me;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I kissed the ground and drank and wrote on it:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"With fire they boiled me to loose my tongue,[FN#243] * And pain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and patience gave for fellowship:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hence comes it hands of men upbear me high * And honey dew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     from lips of maid I sip!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And these also:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Morn saith to Night, withdraw and let me shine; * So drain we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     draughts that dull all pain and pine:[FN#244]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I doubt, so fine the glass, the wine so clear, * If 'tis the wine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     in glass or glass in twine.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The King read my verse and said with a sigh, Were these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gifts[FN#245] in a man, he would excel all the folk of his time"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and age! Then he called for the chess board, and said, Say,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wilt thou play with me?; and I signed with my head, Yes. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I came forward and ordered the pieces and played with him two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"games, both of which I won. He was speechless with surprise; so I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"took the pen case and, drawing forth a reed, wrote on the board"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these two couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Two hosts fare fighting thro' the livelong day * Nor is their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     battling ever finished,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Until, when darkness girdeth them about, * The twain go sleeping"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     in a single bed.[FN#246]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The King read these lines with wonder and delight and said to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Eunuch,[FN#247] O Mukbil, go to thy mistress, Sitt al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Husn,[FN#248] and say her, 'Come, speak the King who biddeth thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hither to take thy solace in seeing this right wondrous ape!' So
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Eunuch went out and presently returned with the lady who,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when she saw me veiled her face and said, O my father! hast thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lost all sense of honour? How cometh it thou art pleased to send
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for me and show me to strange men? O Sitt al-Husn, said he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,no man is here save this little foot page and the Eunuch who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reared thee and I, thy father. From whom, then, cost thou veil"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy face? She answered, This whom thou deemest an ape is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young man, a clever and polite, a wise and learned and the son of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a King; but he is ensorcelled and the Ifrit Jirjaris, who is of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the seed of Iblis, cast a spell upon him, after putting to death"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his own wife the daughter of King Ifitamus lord of the Islands of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Abnus. The King marvelled at his daughter's words and, turning"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to me, said, Is this true that she saith of thee?; and I signed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"by a nod of my head the answer, Yea, verily; and wept sore."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he asked his daughter, Whence knewest thou that he is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ensorcelled?; and she answered, O my dear papa, there was with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me in my childhood an old woman, a wily one and a wise and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"witch to boot, and she taught me the theory of magic and its"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"practice; and I took notes in writing and therein waxed perfect,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and have committed to memory an hundred and seventy chapters of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"egromantic formulas, by the least of which I could transport the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stones of thy city behind the Mountain Kaf and the Circumambient
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Main,[FN#249] or make its site an abyss of the sea and its people"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fishes swimming in the midst of it. O my daughter, said her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"father, I conjure thee, by my life, disenchant this young man,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that I may make him my Wazir and marry thee to him, for indeed he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is an ingenious youth and a deeply learned. With joy and goodly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gree, she replied and, hending in hand an iron knife whereon was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"inscribed the name of Allah in Hebrew characters, she described a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wide circle--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saying her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"               When it was the Fourteenth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy," She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Kalandar continued his tale thus:--O my lady, the King's daughter"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hent in hand a knife whereon were inscribed Hebrew characters and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"described a wide circle in the midst of the palace hall, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,therein wrote in Cufic letters mysterious names and talismans;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she uttered words and muttered charms, some of which we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,understood and others we understood not. Presently the world waxed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dark before our sight till we thought that the sky was falling
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon our heads, and lo! the Ifrit presented himself in his own"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shape and aspect. His hands were like many pronged pitch forks,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his legs like the masts of great ships, and his eyes like"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cressets of gleaming fire. We were in terrible fear of him but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King's daughter cried at him, No welcome to thee and no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"greeting, O dog! whereupon he changed to the form of a lion and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, O traitress, how is it thou hast broken the oath we sware"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that neither should contraire other! O accursed one, answered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she, how could there be a compact between me and the like of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee? Then said he, Take what thou has brought on thy self;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the lion opened his jaws and rushed upon her; but she was too
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quick for him; and, plucking a hair from her head, waved it in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the air muttering over it the while; and the hair straightway
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"became a trenchant sword blade, wherewith she smote the lion and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cut him in twain. Then the two halves flew away in air and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,head changed to a scorpion and the Princess became a huge serpent
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and set upon the accursed scorpion, and the two fought, coiling"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and uncoiling, a stiff fight for an hour at least. Then the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,scorpion changed to a vulture and the serpent became an eagle
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which set upon the vulture, and hunted him for an hour's time,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till he became a black tom cat, which miauled and grinned and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,spat. Thereupon the eagle changed into a piebald wolf and these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"two battled in the palace for a long time, when the cat, seeing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself overcome, changed into a worm and crept into a huge red"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pomegranate,[FN#250] which lay beside the jetting fountain in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,midst of the palace hall. Whereupon the pomegranate swelled to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the size of a water melon in air; and, falling upon the marble"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pavement of the palace, broke to pieces, and all the grains fell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out and were scattered about till they covered the whole floor.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then the wolf shook himself and became a snow white cock, which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fell to picking up the grains purposing not to leave one; but by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,doom of destiny one seed rolled to the fountain edge and there
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lay hid. The cock fell to crowing and clapping his wings and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"signing to us with his beak as if to ask, ' Are any grains left?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But we understood not what he meant, and he cried to us with so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loud a cry that we thought the palace would fall upon us. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ran over all the floor till he saw the grain which had rolled to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the fountain edge, and rushed eagerly to pick it up when behold,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it sprang into the midst of the water and became a fish and dived
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to the bottom of the basin. Thereupon the cock changed to a big
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fish, and plunged in after the other, and the two disappeared for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a while and lo! we heard loud shrieks and cries of pain which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made us tremble. After this the Ifrit rose out of the water, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he was as a burning flame; casting fire and smoke from his mouth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and eyes and nostrils. And immediately the Princess likewise came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth from the basin and she was one live coal of flaming lowe;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and these two, she and he, battled for the space of an hour,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,until their fires entirely compassed them about and their thick
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"smoke filled the palace. As for us we panted for breath, being"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"well nigh suffocated, and we longed to plunge into the water"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fearing lest we be burnt up and utterly destroyed; and the King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Glorious, the Great! Verily we are Allah's and unto Him are we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,returning! Would Heaven I had not urged my daughter to attempt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the disenchantment of this ape fellow, whereby I have imposed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon her the terrible task of fighting yon accursed Ifrit against
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whom all the Ifrits in the world could not prevail. And would
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Heaven we had never seen this ape, Allah never assain nor bless"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the day of his coming! We thought to do a good deed by him before
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the face of Allah,[FN#251] and to release him from enchantment,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and now we have brought this trouble and travail upon our heart.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But I, O my lady, was tongue tied and powerless to say a word to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him. Suddenly, ere we were ware of aught, the Ifrit yelled out"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from under the flames and, coming up to us as we stood on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"estrade, blew fire in our faces. The damsel overtook him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,breathed blasts of fire at his face and the sparks from her and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from him rained down upon us, and her sparks did us no harm, but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one of his sparks alighted upon my eye and destroyed it making me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a monocular ape; and another fell on the King's face scorching
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the lower half, burning off his beard and mustachios and causing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his under teeth to fall out; while a third alighted on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Castrato's breast, killing him on the spot. So we despaired of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"life and made sure of death when lo! a voice repeated the saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah is most Highest! Allah is most Highest! Aidance and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,victory to all who the Truth believe; and disappointment and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"disgrace to all who the religion of Mohammed, the Moon of Faith,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unbelieve. The speaker was the Princess who had burnt the Ifrit,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he was become a heap of ashes. Then she came up to us and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, Reach me a cup of water. They brought it to her and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spoke over it words we understood not, and sprinkling me with it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried, By virtue of the Truth, and by the Most Great name of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, I charge thee return to thy former shape. And behold, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shook, and became a man as before, save that I had utterly lost"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"an eye. Then she cried out, The fire! The fire! O my dear papa"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"an arrow from the accursed hath wounded me to the death, for I am"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not used to fight with the Jann; had he been a man I had slain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him in the beginning. I had no trouble till the time when the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pomegranate burst and the grains scattered, but I overlooked the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seed wherein was the very life of the Jinni. Had I picked it up
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he had died on the spot, but as Fate and Fortune decreed, I saw"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it not; so he came upon me all unawares and there befel between
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him and me a sore struggle under the earth and high in air and in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the water; and, as often as I opened on him a gate,[FN#252] he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"opened on me another gate and a stronger, till at last he opened"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on me the gate of fire, and few are saved upon whom the door of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fire openeth. But Destiny willed that my cunning prevail over his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cunning; and I burned him to death after I vainly exhorted him to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,embrace the religion of al-Islam. As for me I am a dead woman;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah supply my place to you! Then she called upon Heaven for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,help and ceased not to implore relief from the fire; when lo! a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,black spark shot up from her robed feet to her thighs; then it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,flew to her bosom and thence to her face. When it reached her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"face she wept and said, I testify that there is no god but the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,God and that Mahommed is the Apostle of God! And we looked at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her and saw naught but a heap of ashes by the side of the heap
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that had been the Ifrit. We mourned for her and I wished I had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"been in her place, so had I not seen her lovely face who had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,worked me such weal become ashes; but there is no gainsaying the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will of Allah. When the King saw his daughter's terrible death,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he plucked out what was left of his beard and beat his face and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rent his raiment; and I did as he did and we both wept over her.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then came in the Chamberlains and Grandees and were amazed to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,find two heaps of ashes and the Sultan in a fainting fit; so they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stood round him till he revived and told them what had befallen
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his daughter from the Ifrit; whereat their grief was right
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,grievous and the women and the slave girls shrieked and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"keened,[FN#253] and they continued their lamentations for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,space of seven days. Moreover the King bade build over his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter's ashes a vast vaulted tomb, and burn therein wax tapers"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and sepulchral lamps: but as for the Ifrit's ashes they scattered
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them on the winds, speeding them to the curse of Allah. Then the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Sultan fell sick of a sickness that well nigh brought him to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"death for a month's space; and, when health returned to him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his beard grew again and he had been converted by the mercy of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah to al-Islam, he sent for me and said, O youth, Fate had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"decreed for us the happiest of lives, safe from all the chances"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and changes of Time, till thou camest to us, when troubles fell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon us. Would to Heaven we had never seen thee and the foul face
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of thee! For we took pity on thee and thereby we have lost our
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all. I have on thy account first lost my daughter who to me was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"well worth an hundred men, secondly I have suffered that which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befel me by reason of the fire and the loss of my teeth, and my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Eunuch also was slain. I blame thee not, for it was out of thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,power to prevent this: the doom of Allah was on thee as well as
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on us and thanks be to the Almighty for that my daughter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"delivered thee, albeit thereby she lost her own life! Go forth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"now, O my son, from this my city, and suffice thee what hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befallen us through thee, even although 'twas decreed for us. Go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth in peace; and if I ever see thee again I will surely slay
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee. And he cried out at me. So I went forth from his presence,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my lady, weeping bitterly and hardly believing in my escape and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,knowing not whither I should wend. And I recalled all that had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befallen me, my meeting the tailor, my love for the damsel in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"palace beneath the earth, and my narrow escape from the Ifrit,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,even after he had determined to do me die; and how I had entered
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the city as an ape and was now leaving it a man once more. Then I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gave thanks to Allah and said, My eye and not my life! and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before leaving the place I entered the bath and shaved my poll
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and beard and mustachios and eye brows; and cast ashes on my head
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and donned the coarse black woollen robe of a Kalandar. Then I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fared forth, O my lady, and every day I pondered all the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"calamities which had betided me, and I wept and repeated these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I am distraught, yet verily His ruth abides with me, * Tho'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     round me gather hosts of ills, whence come I cannot see:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Patient I'll be till Patience self with me impatient wax; *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Patient for ever till the Lord fulfil my destiny:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Patient I'll bide without complaint, a wronged and vanquish man;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     * Patient as sunparcht wight that spans the desert's sandy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     sea:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Patient I'll be till Aloe's[FN#254] self unwittingly allow * I'm
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     patient under bitterer things than bitterest aloë:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"No bitterer things than aloes or than patience for mankind, * Yet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bitterer than the twain to me were Patience' treachery:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,My sere and seamed and seared brow would dragoman my sore *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     If soul could search my sprite and there unsecret secrecy:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Were hills to bear the load I bear they'd crumble 'neath the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"    weight, * 'Twould still the roaring wind, 'twould quench the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"    flame-tongue's flagrancy,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And whoso saith the world is sweet certès a day he'll see * With
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     more than aloes' bitterness and aloes' pungency.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then I journeyed through many regions and saw many a city
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"intending for Baghdad, that I might seek audience, in the House"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of Peace,[FN#255] with the Commander of the Faithful and tell him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all that had befallen me. I arrived here this very night and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"found my brother in Allah, this first Kalandar, standing about as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one perplexed; so I saluted him with Peace be upon thee, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered into discourse with him. Presently up came our brother,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this third Kalandar, and said to us, Peace be with you! I am a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stranger; whereto we replied, And we too be strangers, who have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,come hither this blessed night. So we all three walked on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"together, none of us knowing the other's history, till Destiny"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,crave us to this door and we came in to you. Such then is my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"story and my reason for shaving my beard and mustachios, and this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is what caused the loss of my eye. Said the house mistress, Thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tale is indeed a rare; so rub thy head and wend thy ways; but he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, I will not budge till I hear my companions' stories."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then came forward the third Kalandar, and said, O illustrious"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady! my history is not like that of these my comrades, but more"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wondrous and far more marvellous. In their case Fate and Fortune
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came down on them unawares; but I drew down destiny upon my own
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"head and brought sorrow on mine own soul, and shaved my own beard"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and lost my own eye. Hear then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Third Kalandar's Tale.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O my lady, that I also am a King and the son of a King and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my name is Ajíb son of Kazíb. When my father died I succeeded
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him; and I ruled and did justice and dealt fairly by all my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lieges. I delighted in sea trips, for my capital stood on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shore, before which the ocean stretched far and wide; and near"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hand were many great islands with sconces and garrisons in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"midst of the main. My fleet numbered fifty merchantmen, and as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"many yachts for pleasance, and an hundred and fifty sail ready"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fitted for holy war with the Unbelievers. It fortuned that I had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a mind to enjoy myself on the islands aforesaid, so I took ship"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with my people in ten keel; and, carrying with me a month's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"victual, I set out on a twenty days' voyage. But one night a head"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wind struck us, and the sea rose against us with huge waves; the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,billows sorely buffetted us and a dense darkness settled round
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us. We gave ourselves up for lost and I said, Whoso endangereth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his days, e'en an he 'scape deserveth no praise. Then we prayed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to Allah and besought Him; but the storm blasts ceased not to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blow against us nor the surges to strike us till morning broke
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when the gale fell, the seas sank to mirrory stillness and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sun shone upon us kindly clear. Presently we made an island where
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"we landed and cooked somewhat of food, and ate heartily and took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,our rest for a couple of days. Then we set out again and sailed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"other twenty days, the seas broadening and the land shrinking."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Presently the current ran counter to us, and we found ourselves"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in strange waters, where the Captain had lost his reckoning, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was wholly bewildered in this sea; so said we to the look out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man,[FN#256] Get thee to the mast head and keep thine eyes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"open. He swarmed up the mast and looked out and cried aloud, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Rais, I espy to starboard something dark, very like a fish"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"floating on the face of the sea, and to larboard there is a loom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in the midst of the main, now black and now bright. When the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Captain heard the look out's words he dashed his turband on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deck and plucked out his beard and beat his face saying, Good"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,news indeed! we be all dead men; not one of us can be saved. And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he fell to weeping and all of us wept for his weeping and also
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for our lives; and I said, O Captain, tell us what it is the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"look out saw. O my Prince, answered he, know that we lost our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"course on the night of the storm, which was followed on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,morrow by a two days' calm during which we made no way; and we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have gone astray eleven days reckoning from that night, with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ne'er a wind to bring us back to our true course. Tomorrow by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the end of the day we shall come to a mountain of black stone,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,highs the Magnet Mountain;[FN#257] for thither the currents carry
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us willy-nilly. As soon as we are under its lea, the ship's sides"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will open and every nail in plank will fly out and cleave fast to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the mountain; for that Almighty Allah hath gifted the loadstone
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with a mysterious virtue and a love for iron, by reason whereof"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all which is iron travelleth towards it; and on this mountain is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"much iron, how much none knoweth save the Most High, from the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,many vessels which have been lost there since the days of yore.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The bright spot upon its summit is a dome of yellow laton from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Andalusia, vaulted upon ten columns; and on its crown is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,horseman who rideth a horse of brass and holdeth in hand a lance
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of laton; and there hangeth on his bosom a tablet of lead graven
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with names and talismans. And he presently added, And, O King,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"none destroyeth folk save the rider on that steed, nor will the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,egromancy be dispelled till he fall from his horse.''[FN#258]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then, O my lady, the Captain wept with exceeding weeping and we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all made sure of death doom and each and every one of us
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,farewelled his friend and charged him with his last will and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,testament in case he might be saved. We slept not that night and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in the morning we found ourselves much nearer the Loadstone
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Mountain, whither the waters crave us with a violent send. When"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the ships were close under its lea they opened and the nails flew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out and all the iron in them sought the Magnet Mountain and clove
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to it like a network; so that by the end of the day we were all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,struggling in the waves round about the mountain. Some of us were
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saved, but more were drowned and even those who had escaped knew"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not one another, so stupefied were they by the beating of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"billows and the raving of the winds. As for me, O my lady, Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,(be His name exalted!) preserved my life that I might suffer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whatso He willed to me of hardship, misfortune and calamity; for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I scrambled upon a plank from one of the ships, and the wind and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,waters threw it at the feet of the Mountain. There I found a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,practicable path leading by steps carven out of the rock to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"summit, and I called on the name of Allah Almighty[FN#259]--And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                When it was the Fifteenth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,third Kalandar said to the lady (the rest of the party sitting
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fast bound and the slaves standing with swords drawn over their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heads):--And after calling on the name of Almighty Allah and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"passionately beseeching Him, I breasted the ascent, clinging to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the steps and notches hewn in the stone, and mounted little by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"little. And the Lord stilled the wind and aided me in the ascent,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so that I succeeded in reaching the summit. There I found no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"resting place save the dome, which I entered, joying with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,exceeding joy at my escape; and made the Wuzu-ablution[FN#260]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and prayed a two bow prayer,[FN#261] a thanksgiving to God for my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"preservation. Then I fell asleep under the dome, and heard in my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dream a mysterious Voice[FN#262] saying, O son of Khazib! when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou wakest from thy sleep dig under thy feet and thou shalt find
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a bow of brass and three leaden arrows, inscribed with talismans"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and characts. Take the bow and shoot the arrows at the horseman
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on the dome top and free mankind from this sore calamity. When
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou hast shot him he shall fall into the sea, and the horse will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,also drop at thy feet: then bury it in the place of the bow. This
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"done, the main will swell and rise till it is level with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mountain head, and there will appear on it a skiff carrying a man"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of laton (other than he thou shalt have shot) holding in his hand
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a pair of paddles. He will come to thee and do thou embark with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him but beware of saying Bismillah or of otherwise naming Allah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Almighty. He will row thee for a space of ten days, till he bring"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee to certain Islands called the Islands of Safety, and thence"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou shalt easily reach a port and find those who will convey
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee to thy native land; and all this shall be fulfilled to thee
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so thou call not on the name of Allah. Then I started up from my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sleep in joy and gladness and, hastening to do the bidding of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mysterious Voice, found the bow and arrows and shot at the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"horseman and tumbled him into the main, whilst the horse dropped"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at my feet; so I took it and buried it. Presently the sea surged
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up and rose till it reached the top of the mountain; nor had I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,long to wait ere I saw a skiff in the offing coming towards me. I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gave thanks to Allah; and, when the skiff came up to me, I saw"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,therein a man of brass with a tablet of lead on his breast
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,inscribed with talismans and characts; and I embarked without
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,uttering a word. The boatman rowed on with me through the first
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"day and the second and the third, in all ten whole days, till I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,caught sight of the Islands of Safety; whereat I joyed with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding joy and for stress of gladness exclaimed, Allah!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah! In the name of Allah! There is no god but the God and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah is Almighty.''[FN#263] Thereupon the skiff forthwith upset
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and cast me upon the sea; then it righted and sank deep into the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"depths. Now I am a fair swimmer, so I swam the whole day till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nightfall, when my forearms and shoulders were numbed with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fatigue and I felt like to die; so I testified to my faith,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,expecting naught but death. The sea was still surging under the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"violence of the winds, and presently there came a billow like a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hillock; and, bearing me up high in air, threw me with a long"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cast on dry land, that His will might be fulfilled. I crawled up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the beach and doffing my raiment wrung it out to dry and spread
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it in the sunshine: then I lay me down and slept the whole night.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"As soon as it was day, I donned my clothes and rose to look"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whither I should walk. Presently I came to a thicket of low
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"trees; and, making a cast round it, found that the spot whereon I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stood was an islet, a mere holm, girt on all sides by the ocean;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereupon I said to myself, Whatso freeth me from one great"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,calamity casteth me into a greater! But while I was pondering my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"case and longing for death behold, I saw afar off a ship making"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for the island; so I clomb a tree and hid myself among the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"branches. Presently the ship anchored and landed ten slaves,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blackamoors, bearing iron hoes and baskets, who walked on till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they reached the middle of the island. Here they dug deep into
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the ground, until they uncovered a plate of metal which they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lifted, thereby opening a trap door. After this they returned to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the ship and thence brought bread and flour, honey and fruits,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clarified butter,[FN#264] leather bottles containing liquors and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"many household stuffs; also furniture, table service and mirrors"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rugs, carpets and in fact all needed to furnish a dwelling; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they kept going to and fro, and descending by the trap door, till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they had transported into the dwelling all that was in the ship.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,After this the slaves again went on board and brought back with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them garments as rich as may be, and in the midst of them came an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"old, old man, of whom very little was left, for Time had dealt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hardly and harshly with him, and all that remained of him was a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bone wrapped in a rag of blue stuff through which the winds
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whistled west and east. As saith the poet of him:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Time gars me tremble Ah, how sore the baulk! * While Time in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pride of strength cloth ever stalk:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Time was I walked nor ever felt I tired, * Now am I tired albe I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     never walk!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And the Shaykh held by the hand a youth cast in beauty's mould,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all elegance and perfect grace; so fair that his comeliness
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,deserved to be proverbial; for he was as a green bough or the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tender young of the roe, ravishing every heart with his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loveliness and subduing every soul with his coquetry and amorous
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ways.[FN#265] It was of him the poet spake when he said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Beauty they brought with him to make compare, * But Beauty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     hung her head in shame and care:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth' they, O Beauty, hast thou seen his like? * And Beauty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     cried, His like? not anywhere!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"They stinted not their going, O my lady, till all went down by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the trap door and did not reappear for an hour, or rather more;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at the end of which time the slaves and the old man came up
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"without the youth and, replacing the iron plate and carefully"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"closing the door slab as it was before, they returned to the ship"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and made sail and were lost to my sight. When they turned away to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"depart, I came down from the tree and, going to the place I had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seen them fill up, scraped off and removed the earth; and in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,patience possessed my soul till I had cleared the whole of it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"away. Then appeared the trap door which was of wood, in shape and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,size like a millstone; and when I lifted it up it disclosed a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"winding staircase of stone. At this I marvelled and, descending"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the steps till I reached the last, found a fair hall, spread with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"various kinds of carpets and silk stuffs, wherein was a youth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sitting upon a raised couch and leaning back on a round cushion
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with a fan in his hand and nosegays and posies of sweet scented
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,herbs and flowers before him;[FN#266] but he was alone and not a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,soul near him in the great vault. When he saw me he turned pale;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but I saluted him courteously and said, Set thy mind at ease and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,calm thy fears; no harm shall come near thee; I am a man like
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thyself and the son of a King to boot; whom the decrees of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Destiny have sent to bear thee company and cheer thee in thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loneliness. But now tell me, what is thy story and what causeth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee to dwell thus in solitude under the ground? When he was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"assured that I was of his kind and no Jinni, he rejoiced and his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fine colour returned; and, making me draw near to him he said, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my brother, my story is a strange story and 'tis this. My father"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is a merchant-jeweller possessed of great wealth, who hath white"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and black slaves travelling and trading on his account in ships
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and on camels, and trafficking with the most distant cities; but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he was not blessed with a child, not even one. Now on a certain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night he dreamed a dream that he should be favoured with a son,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who would be short lived; so the morning dawned on my father
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bringing him woe and weeping. On the following night my mother
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,conceived and my father noted down the date of her becoming
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pregnant.[FN#267] Her time being fulfilled she bare me; whereat
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my father rejoiced and made banquets and called together the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neighbors and fed the Fakirs and the poor, for that he had been"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blessed with issue near the end of his days. Then he assembled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the astrologers and astronomers who knew the places of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"planets, and the wizards and wise ones of the time, and men"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"learned in horoscopes and nativities,[FN#268] and they drew out"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my birth scheme and said to my father, Thy son shall live to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fifteen years, but in his fifteenth there is a sinister aspect;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,an he safely tide it over he shall attain a great age. And the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cause that threateneth him with death is this. In the Sea of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Peril standeth the Mountain Magnet hight; on whose summit is a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,horseman of yellow laton seated on a horse also of brass and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bearing on his breast a tablet of lead. Fifty days after this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rider shall fall from his steed thy son will die and his slayer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will be he who shoots down the horseman, a Prince named Ajib son"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of King Khazib. My father grieved with exceeding grief to hear
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these words; but reared me in tenderest fashion and educated me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,excellently well until my fifteenth year was told. Ten days ago
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,news came to him that the horseman had fallen into the sea and he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who shot him down was named Ajib son of King Khazib. My father
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thereupon wept bitter tears at the need of parting with me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"became like one possessed of a Jinni. However, being in mortal"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fear for me, he built me this place under the earth; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stocking it with all required for the few days still remaining,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he brought me hither in a ship and left me here. Ten are already
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"past and, when the forty shall have gone by without danger to me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he will come and take me away; for he hath done all this only in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fear of Prince Ajib. Such, then, is my story and the cause of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loneliness. When I heard his history I marvelled and said in my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mind, I am the Prince Ajib who hath done all this; but as Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is with me I will surely not slay him! So said I to him, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lord, far from thee be this hurt and harm and then, please Allah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou shalt not suffer cark nor care nor aught disquietude, for I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will tarry with thee and serve thee as a servant, and then wend"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my ways; and after having borne thee company during the forty
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"days, I will go with thee to thy home where thou shalt give me an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,escort of some of thy Mamelukes with whom I may journey back to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my own city; and the Almighty shall requite thee for me. He was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"glad to hear these words, when I rose and lighted a large wax"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,candle and trimmed the ramps end the three lanterns; and I set on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,meat and drink and sweetmeats. We ate and drank and sat talking
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,over various matters till the greater part of the night was gone;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when he lay down to rest and I covered him up and went to sleep
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"myself. Next morning I arose and warmed a little water, then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lifted him gently so as to awake him and brought him the warm
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"water wherewith he washed his face[FN#269] and said to me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Heaven requite thee for me with every blessing, O youth! By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, if I get quit of this danger and am saved from him whose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"name is Ajib bin Khazib, I will make my father reward thee and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"send thee home healthy and wealthy; and, if I die, then my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blessing be upon thee. I answered, May the day never dawn on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which evil shall betide thee; and may Allah make my last day
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before thy last day! Then I set before him somewhat of food and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"we ate; and I got ready perfumes for fumigating the hall,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wherewith he was pleased. Moreover I made him a Mankalah-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cloth;[FN#270] and we played and ate sweetmeats and we played
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again and took our pleasure till nightfall, when I rose and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lighted the lamps, and set before him somewhat to eat, and sat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,telling him stories till the hours of darkness were far spent.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he lay down to rest and I covered him up and rested also.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And thus I continued to do, O my lady, for days and nights and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"affection for him took root in my heart and my sorrow was eased,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I said to myself, The astrologers lied[FN#271] when they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"predicted that he should be slain by Ajib bin Khazib: by Allah, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will not slay him. I ceased not ministering to him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,conversing and carousing with him and telling him all manner
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tales for thirty nine days. On the fortieth night[FN#272] the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"youth rejoiced and said, O my brother, Alhamdo, lillah!--praise"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be to Allah--who hath preserved me from death and this is by thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blessing and the blessing of thy coming to me and I pray God that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"He restore thee to thy native land. But now, O my brother, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would thou warm me some water for the Ghusl ablution and do thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kindly bathe me and change my clothes. I replied, With love and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gladness; and I heated water in plenty and carrying it in to him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"washed his body all over the washing of health,[FN#273] with meal"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of lupins[FN#274] and rubbed him well and changed his clothes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spread him a high bed whereon he lay down to rest, being drowsy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after bathing. Then said he, O my brother, cut me up a water"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"melon, and sweeten it with a little sugar candy.[FN#275] So I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went to the store room and bringing out a fine water melon I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"found there, set it on a platter and laid it before him saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my master hast thou not a knife? Here it is, answered he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,over my head upon the high shelf. So I got up in haste and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,taking the knife drew it from its sheath; but my foot slipped in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stepping down and I fell heavily upon the youth holding in my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hand the knife which hastened to fulfil what had been written on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Day that decided the destinies of man, and buried itself, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"if planted, in the youth's heart. He died on the instant. When I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw that he was slain and knew that I had slain him, maugre"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"myself, I cried out with an exceeding loud and bitter cry and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beat my face and rent my raiment and said, Verily we be Allah's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and unto Him we be returning, O Moslems! O folk fain of Allah!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there remained for this youth but one day of the forty dangerous
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,days which the astrologers and the learned had foretold for him;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the predestined death of this beautiful one was to be at my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hand. Would Heaven I had not tried to cut the watermelon. What
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dire misfortune is this I must bear fief or loath? What a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"disaster! What an affliction! O Allah mine, I implore thy pardon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and declare to Thee my innocence of his death. But what God
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,willeth let that come to pass.''[FN#276]--And Shahrazad perceived
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                When it was the Sixteenth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ajib thus"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,continued his tale to the lady:--When I was certified that I had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slain him, I arose and ascending the stairs replaced the trap-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,door and covered it with earth as before. Then I looked out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seawards and saw the ship cleaving the waters and making for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"island, wherefore I was afeard and said, The moment they come"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and see the youth done to death, they will know 'twas I who slew"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him and will slay me without respite. So I climbed up into a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,high tree and concealed myself among its leaves; and hardly had I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,done so when the ship anchored and the slaves landed with the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ancient man, the youth's father, and made direct for the place"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and when they removed the earth they were surprised to see it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,soft.[FN#277] Then they raised the trap door and went down and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"found the youth lying at full length, clothed in fair new"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"garments, with a face beaming after the bath, and the knife deep"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in his heart. At the sight they shrieked and wept and beat their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"faces, loudly cursing the murderer; whilst a swoon came over the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shaykh so that the slaves deemed him dead, unable to survive his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,son. At last they wrapped the slain youth in his clothes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,carried him up and laid him on the ground covering him with a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shroud of silk. Whilst they were making for the ship the old man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"revived; and, gazing on his son who was stretched out, fell on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the ground and strewed dust over his head and smote his face and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,plucked out his beard; and his weeping redoubled as he thought of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his murdered son and he swooned away once more. After awhile a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slave went and fetched a strip of silk whereupon they lay the old
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,man and sat down at his head. All this took place and I was on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the tree above them watching everything that came to pass; and my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heart became hoary before my head waxed grey, for the hard lot"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which was mine, and for the distress and anguish I had undergone,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I fell to reciting:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,How many a joy by Allah's will hath fled * With flight escaping
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     sight of wisest head!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"How many a sadness shall begin the day, * Yet grow right"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     gladsome ere the day is sped!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"How many a weal trips on the heels of ill, * Causing the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     mourner's heart with joy to thrill![FN#278]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But the old man, O my lady, ceased not from his swoon till near"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sunset, when he came to himself and, looking upon his dead son,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he recalled what had happened, and how what he had dreaded had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,come to pass; and he beat his face and head and recited these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Racked is my heart by parting fro' my friends * And two rills
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     ever fro' my eyelids flow:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"With them[FN#279] went forth my hopes, Ah, well away! * What"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     shift remaineth me to say or do?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Would I had never looked upon their sight, * What shift, fair"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     sirs, when paths e'er strainer grow?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,What charm shall calm my pangs when this wise burn * Longings
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     of love which in my vitals glow?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Would I had trod with them the road of Death! * Ne'er had befel
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     us twain this parting blow:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah: I pray the Truthful show me Roth * And mix our lives nor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     part them evermo'e!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,How blest were we as 'death one roof we dwelt * Conjoined in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     joys nor recking aught of woe;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Till Fortune shot us pith the severance shaft; * Ah who shall
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     patient bear such parting throe?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And dart of Death struck down amid the tribe * The age's pearl
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     that Morn saw brightest show:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I cried the while his case took speech and said:--* Would Heaven,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     my son, Death mote his doom foreslow!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Which be the readiest road wi' thee to meet * My Son! for whom I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     would my soul bestow?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If sun I call him no! the sun cloth set; * If moon I call him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     wane the moons; Ah no!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O sad mischance o' thee, O doom of days, * Thy place none other"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     love shall ever know:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thy sire distracted sees thee, but despairs * By wit or wisdom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Fate to overthrow:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Some evil eye this day hath cast its spell * And foul befal him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     as it foul befel!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he sobbed a single sob and his soul fled his flesh. The
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slaves shrieked aloud, Alas, our lord! and showered dust on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their heads and redoubled their weeping and wailing. Presently
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they carried their dead master to the ship side by side with his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dead son and, having transported all the stuff from the dwelling"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the vessel, set sail and disappeared from mine eyes. I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"descended from the tree and, raising the trap-door, went down"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,into the underground dwelling where everything reminded me of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,youth; and I looked upon the poor remains of him and began
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,repeating these verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Their tracks I see, and pine with pain and pang * And on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     deserted hearths I weep and yearn:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And Him I pray who doomed them depart * Some day vouchsafe
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     the boon of safe return.''[FN#280]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then, O my lady, I went up again by the trap-door, and every day"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I used to wander round about the island and every night I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned to the underground hall. Thus I lived for a month, till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at last, looking at the western side of the island, I observed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that every day the tides ebbed, leaving shallow water for which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the flow did not compensate; and by the end of the month the sea
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,showed dry land in that direction. At this I rejoiced making
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,certain of my safety; so I arose and fording what little was left
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the water got me to the mainland, where I fell in with great"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heaps of loose sand in which even a camel's hoof would sink up to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the knee.[FN#281] However I emboldened my soul and wading through
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the sand behold, a fire shone from afar burning with a brazing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"light.[FN#282] So I made for it hoping haply to find succour, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,broke out into these verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Belike Fortune may her bridle turn * And Time bring weal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     although he's jealous hight;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Forward my hopes, and further all my needs, * And passed ills"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     with present weals requite.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And when I drew near the fire aforesaid lo! it was a palace with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gates of copper burnished red which, when the rising sun shone"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thereon, gleamed and glistened from afar showing what had seemed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to me a fire. I rejoiced in the sight, and sat down over against"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the gate, but I was hardly settled in my seat before there met me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ten young men clothed in sumptuous gear and all were blind of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,left eye which appeared as plucked out. They were accompanied by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a Shaykh, an old, old man, and much I marvelled at their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"appearance, and their all being blind of the same eye. When they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw me, they saluted me with the Salam and asked me of my case"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and my history; whereupon I related to them all what had befallen
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, and what full measure of misfortune was mine. Marvelling at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my tale they took me to the mansion, where I saw ranged round the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hall ten couches each with its blue bedding and coverlet of blue
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stuff[FN#283] and amiddlemost stood a smaller couch furnished
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,like them with blue and nothing else. As we entered each of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,youths took his seat on his own couch and the old man seated
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself upon the smaller one in the middle saying to me, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"youth, sit thee down on the floor and ask not of our case nor of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the loss of our eyes. Presently he rose up and set before each
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young man some meat in a charger and drink in a large mazer,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,treating me in like manner; and after that they sat questioning
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me concerning my adventures and what had betided me: and I kept
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,telling them my tale till the night was far spent. Then said the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young men, O our Shaykh, wilt not thou set before us our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ordinary? The time is come. He replied, With love and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gladness, and rose and entering a closet disappeared, but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,presently returned bearing on his head ten trays each covered
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with a strip of blue stuff. He set a tray before each youth and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lighting ten wax candles, he stuck one upon each tray, and drew"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,off the covers and lo! under them was naught but ashes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,powdered charcoal and kettle soot. Then all the young men tucked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up their sleeves to the elbows and fell a weeping and wailing and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they blackened their faces and smeared their clothes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"buffetted their brows and beat their breasts, continually"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exclaiming, We were sitting at our ease but our frowardness"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brought us unease!  They ceased not to do this till dawn drew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nigh, when the old man rose and heated water for them; and they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"washed their faces, and donned other and clean clothes. Now when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I saw this, O my lady, for very wonderment my senses left me and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my wits went wild and heart and head were full of thought, till I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forgot what had betided me and I could not keep silence feeling I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fain must speak out and question them of these strangenesses; so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I said to them, How come ye to do this after we have been so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,open hearted and frolicksome? Thanks be to Allah ye be all sound
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and sane, yet actions such as these befit none but mad men or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,those possessed of an evil spirit. I conjure you by all that is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dearest to you, why stint ye to tell me your history, and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cause of your losing your eyes and your blackening your faces
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with ashes and soot? Hereupon they turned to me and said, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young man, hearken not to thy youthtide's suggestions and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,question us no questions. Then they slept and I with them and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when they awoke the old man brought us somewhat of food; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after we had eaten and the plates and goblets had been removed,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they sat conversing till night fall when the old man rose and lit
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the wax candles and lamps and set meat and drink before us. After
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,we had eaten and drunken we sat conversing and carousing in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"companionage till the noon of night, when they said to the old"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man, Bring us our ordinary, for the hour of sleep is at hand!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So he rose and brought them the trays of soot and ashes; and they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"did as they had done on the preceding night, nor more, nor less."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I abode with them after this fashion for the space of a month
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,during which time they used to blacken their faces with ashes
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"every night, and to wash and change their raiment when the morn"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was young; and I but marvelled the more and my scruples and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,curiosity increased to such a point that I had to forego even
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"food and drink. At last, I lost command of myself, for my heart"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was aflame with fire unquenchable and lowe unconcealable and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, O young men, will ye not relieve my trouble and acquaint"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me with the reason of thus blackening your faces and the meaning
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of your words:--We were sitting at our ease but our frowardness
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brought us unease? Quoth they 'Twere better to keep these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,things secret. Still I was bewildered by their doings to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"point of abstaining from eating and drinking and, at last wholly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"losing patience, quoth I to them, There is no help for it: ye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,must acquaint me with what is the reason of these doings. They
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, We kept our secret only for thy good: to gratify thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will bring down evil upon thee and thou wilt become a monocular
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"even as we are. I repeated There is no help for it and, if ye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will not, let me leave you and return to mine own people and be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at rest from seeing these things, for the proverb saith:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Better ye 'bide and I take my leave: * For what eye sees not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     heart shall never grieve.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thereupon they said to me, Remember, O youth, that should ill"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,befal thee we will not again harbour thee nor suffer thee to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,abide amongst us; and bringing a ram they slaughtered it and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"skinned it. Lastly they gave me a knife saying, Take this skin"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and stretch thyself upon it and we will sew it around thee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"presently there shall come to thee a certain bird, hight"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Rukh,[FN#284] that will catch thee up in his pounces and tower"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,high in air and then set thee down on a mountain. When thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feelest he is no longer flying, rip open the pelt with this blade"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and come out of it; the bird will be scared and will fly away and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leave thee free. After this fare for half a day, and the march"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will place thee at a palace wondrous fair to behold, towering"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"high in air and builded of Khalanj[FN#285], lign-aloes and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sandal-wood, plated with red gold, and studded with all manner"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,emeralds and costly gems fit for seal rings. Enter it and thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shalt win to thy wish for we have all entered that palace; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,such is the cause of our losing our eyes and of our blackening
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,our faces. Were we now to tell thee our stories it would take too
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,long a time; for each and every of us lost his left eye by an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,adventure of his own. I rejoiced at their words and they did
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with me as they said; and the bird Rukh bore me off end set me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down on the mountain. Then I came out of the skin and walked on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till I reached the palace. The door stood open as I entered and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"found myself in a spacious and goodly hall, wide exceedingly,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,even as a horse-course; and around it were an hundred chambers
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with doors of sandal and aloes woods plated with red gold and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,furnished with silver rings by way of knockers.[FN#286] At the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"head or upper end[FN#287] of the hall I saw forty damsels,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sumptuously dressed and ornamented and one and all bright as
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,moons; none could ever tire of gazing upon them and all so lovely
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that the most ascetic devotee on seeing them would become their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slave and obey their will. When they saw me the whole bevy came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up to me and said Welcome and well come and good cheer[FN#288]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to thee, O our lord! This whole month have we been expecting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee. Praised be Allah who hath sent us one who is worthy of us,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,even as we are worthy of him! Then they made me sit down upon a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"high divan and said to me, This day thou art our lord and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"master, and we are thy servants and thy hand-maids, so order us"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,as thou wilt. And I marvelled at their case. Presently one of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them arose and set meat before me and I ate and they ate with me;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whilst others warmed water and washed my hands and feet and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,changed my clothes and others made ready sherbets and gave us to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drink; and all gathered around me being full of joy and gladness
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at my coming. Then they sat down and conversed with me till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nightfall, when five of them arose and laid the trays and spread"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them with flowers and fragrant herbs and fruits, fresh and dried,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and confections in profusion. At last they brought out a fine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wine service with rich old wine; and we sat down to drink and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,some sang songs and others played the lute and psaltery and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"recorders and other instruments, and the bowl went merrily round."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hereupon such gladness possessed me that I forgot the sorrows of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the world one and all and said, This is indeed life; O sad that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tis fleeting! I enjoyed their company till the time came for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rest; and our heads were all warm with wine, when they said, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"our lord, choose from amongst us her who shall be thy bed-fellow"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this night and not lie with thee again till forty days be past.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So I chose a girl fair of face and perfect in shape, with eyes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Kohl-edged by nature's hand;[FN#289] hair long and jet black with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slightly parted teeth[FN#290] and joining brows: 'twas as if she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,were some limber graceful branchlet or the slender stalk of sweet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"basil to amaze and to bewilder man's fancy, even as the poet said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of such an one--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,To even her with greeny bough were vain * Fool he who finds her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     beauties in the roe:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When hath the roe those lively lovely limbs * Or honey dews those
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     lips alone bestow?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Those eyne, soul piercing eyne, which slay with love, * Which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bind the victim by their shafts laid low?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,My heart to second childhood they beguiled * No wonder: love
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     sick-man again is child!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And I repeated to her the maker's words who said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"None other charms but thine shall greet mine eyes, * Nor other"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     image can my heart surprise:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thy love, my lady, captives all my thoughts * And on that love"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     I'll die and I'll arise.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So I lay with her that night; none fairer I ever knew; and, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it was morning, the damsels carried me to the Hammam bath and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bathed me and robed me in fairest apparel. Then they served up
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"food, and we ate and drank and the cup went round till nightfall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when I chose from among them one fair of form and face, soft-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sided and a model of grace, such an one as the poet described"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when he said.--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"On her fair bosom caskets twain I scanned, * Sealed fast with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     musk seals lovers to withstand
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"With arrowy glances stand on guard her eyes, * Whose shafts"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     would shoot who dares put forth a hand.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"With her I spent a most goodly night; and, to be brief, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mistress, I remained with them in all solace and delight of life,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eating and drinking, conversing and carousing and every night"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lying with one or other of them. But at the head of the new year
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they came to me in tears and bade me farewell, weeping and crying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out and clinging about me: whereat I wondered and said, What may"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be the matter? verily you break my heart! They exclaimed, Would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Heaven we had never known thee; for, though we have companies"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with many, yet never saw we a pleasanter than thou or a more"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"courteous. And they wept again. But tell me more clearly,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asked I, what causeth this weeping which maketh my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gall-bladder[FN#291] like to burst; and they answered, O our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lord and master, it is severance which maketh us weep; and thou,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and thou only, art the cause of our tears. If thou hearken to us"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,we need never be parted and if thou hearken not we part for ever;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but our hearts tell us that thou wilt not listen to our words and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this is the cause of our tears and cries. Tell me how the case
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"standeth? Know, O our lord, that we are the daughters of Kings"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who have met here and have lived together for years; and once in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,every year we are perforce absent for forty days; and afterwards
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,we return and abide here for the rest of the twelve month eating
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and drinking and taking our pleasure and enjoying delights: we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,are about to depart according to our custom; and we fear lest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after we be gone thou contraire our charge and disobey our
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,injunctions. Here now we commit to thee the keys of the palace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which containeth forty chambers and thou mayest open of these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thirty and nine, but beware (and we conjure thee by Allah and by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the lives of us!) lest thou open the fortieth door, for therein"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is that which shall separate us for ever.[FN#292] Quoth I,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Assuredly I will not open it, if it contain the cause of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,severance from you. Then one among them came up to me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,falling on my neck wept and recited these verses.--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If Time unite us after absent while, * The world harsh frowning"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     on our lot shall smile
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And if thy semblance deign adorn mine eyes,[FN#293] * I'll"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pardon Time past wrongs and by gone guile.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And I recited the following:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When drew she near to bid adieu with heart unstrung, * While"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     care and longing on that day her bosom wrung
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wet pearls she wept and mine like red carnelians rolled * And,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     joined in sad rivière, around her neck they hung."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I saw her weeping I said, By Allah I will never open that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fortieth door, never and no wise! and I bade her farewell."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thereupon all departed flying away like birds; signalling with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their hands farewells as they went and leaving me alone in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,palace. When evening drew near I opened the door of the first
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chamber and entering it found myself in a place like one of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pleasaunces of Paradise. It was a garden with trees of freshest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,green and ripe fruits of yellow sheen; and its birds were singing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,clear and keen and rills ran wimpling through the fair terrene.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The sight and sounds brought solace to my sprite; and I walked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"among the trees, and I smelt the breath of the flowers on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,breeze; and heard the birdies sing their melodies hymning the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"One, the Almighty in sweetest litanies; and I looked upon the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,apple whose hue is parcel red and parcel yellow; as said the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,poet:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Apple whose hue combines in union mellow * My fair's red cheek,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     her hapless lover's yellow.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then I looked upon the quince, and inhaled its fragrance which to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shame musk and ambergris, even as the poet hath said :"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Quince every taste conjoins; in her are found * Gifts which for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     queen of fruits the Quince have crowned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Her taste is wine, her scent the waft of musk; * Pure gold her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     hue, her shape the Moon's fair round."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then I looked upon the pear whose taste surpasseth sherbet and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sugar; and the apricot[FN#294] whose beauty striketh the eye with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"admiration, as if she were a polished ruby. Then I went out of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the place and locked the door as it was before. When it was the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,morrow I opened the second door; and entering found myself in a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,spacious plain set with tall date palms and watered by a running
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stream whose banks were shrubbed with bushes of rose and jasmine,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"while privet and eglantine, oxe-eye, violet and lily, narcissus,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,origane and the winter gilliflower carpeted the borders; and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,breath of the breeze swept over these sweet smelling growths
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"diffusing their delicious odours right and left, perfuming the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,world and filling my soul with delight. After taking my pleasure
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there awhile I went from it and, having closed the door as it was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before, opened the third door wherein I saw a high open hall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pargetted with parti-coloured marbles and pietra dura of price
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and other precious stones, and hung with cages of sandal-wood and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eagle-wood; full of birds which made sweet music, such as the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thousand voiced,[FN#295] and the cushat, the merle, the turtle-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dove and the Nubian ring dove. My heart was filled with pleasure
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thereby; my grief was dispelled and I slept in that aviary till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dawn. Then I undocked the door of the fourth chamber and therein
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,found a grand saloon with forty smaller chambers giving upon it.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,All their doors stood open: so I entered and found them full of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pearls and jacinths and beryls and emeralds and corals and car
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"buncles, and all manner precious gems and jewels, such as tongue"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of man may not describe. My thought was stunned at the sight and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I said to myself, These be things methinks united which could"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not be found save in the treasuries of a King of Kings, nor could"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the monarchs of the world have collected the like of these! And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my heart dilated and my sorrows ceased, For, quoth I, now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"verily am I the monarch of the age, since by Allah's grace this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,enormous wealth is mine; and I have forty damsels under my hand
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nor is there any to claim them save myself. Then I gave not over
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,opening place after place until nine and thirty days were passed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and in that time I had entered every chamber except that one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whose door the Princesses had charged me not to open. But my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thoughts, O my mistress, ever ran on that forbidden"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fortieth[FN#296] and Satan urged me to open it for my own
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"undoing; nor had I patience to forbear, albeit there wanted of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the trysting time but a single day. So I stood before the chamber
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"aforesaid and, after a moment's hesitation, opened the door which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was plated with red gold, and entered. I was met by a perfume"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whose like I had never before smelt; and so sharp and subtle was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the odour that it made my senses drunken as with strong wine, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I fell to the ground in a fainting fit which lasted a full hour.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I came to myself I strengthened my heart and, entering,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,found myself in a chamber whose floor was bespread with saffron
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and blazing with light from branched candelabra of gold and lamps
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fed with costly oils, which diffused the scent of musk and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ambergris. I saw there also two great censers each big as a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mazer-bowl,[FN#297] flaming with lign-aloes, nadd-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"perfume,[FN#298] ambergris and honied scents; and the place was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"full of their fragrance. Presently, O my lady, I espied a noble"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"steed, black as the murks of night when murkiest, standing, ready"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saddled and bridled (and his saddle was of red gold) before two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mangers, one of clear crystal wherein was husked sesame, and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,other also of crystal containing water of the rose scented with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"musk. When I saw this I marvelled and said to myself, Doubtless"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in this animal must be some wondrous mystery; and Satan cozened
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, so I led him without the palace end mounted him, but he would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not stir from his place. So I hammered his sides with my heels,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but he moved not, and then I took the rein whip,[FN#299] and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"struck him withal. When he felt the blow, he neighed a neigh with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a sound like deafening thunder and, opening a pair of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wings[FN#300] flew up with me in the firmament of heaven far
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,beyond the eyesight of man. After a full hour of flight he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,descended and alighted on a terrace roof and shaking me off his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,back lashed me on the face with his tail and gouged out my left
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eye causing it roll along my cheek. Then he flew away. I went
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down from the terrace and found myself again amongst the ten one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eyed youths sitting upon their ten couches with blue covers; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they cried out when they saw me, No welcome to thee, nor aught"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of good cheer! We all lived of lives the happiest and we ate and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drank of the best; upon brocades and cloths of gold we took rest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and we slept with our heads on beauty's breast, but we could not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"await one day to gain the delights of a year! Quoth I, Behold I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have become one like unto you and now I would have you bring me a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tray full of blackness, wherewith to blacken my face, and receive"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me into your society. No, by Allah, quoth they, thou shalt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not sojourn with us and now get thee hence! So they drove me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,away. Finding them reject me thus I foresaw that matters would go
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hard with me, and I remembered the many miseries which Destiny"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had written upon my forehead; and I fared forth from among them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heavy hearted and tearful eyed, repeating to myself these words,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I was sitting at mine ease but my frowardness brought me to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unease. Then I shaved beard and mustachios and eye brows,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"renouncing the world, and wandered in Kalandar garb about"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah's earth; and the Almighty decreed safety for me till I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arrived at Baghdad, which was on the evening of this very night."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Here I met these two other Kalandars standing bewildered; so I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saluted them saying, I am a stranger! and they answered, And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,we likewise be strangers! By the freak of Fortune we were like
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to like, three Kalandars and three monoculars all blind of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"left eye. Such, O my lady, is the cause of the shearing of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beard and the manner of my losing an eye. Said the lady to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Rub thy head and wend thy ways; but he answered, By Allah, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will not go until I hear the stories of these others. Then the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady, turning towards the Caliph and Ja'afar and Masrur, said to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them, Do ye also give an account of yourselves, you men!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Whereupon Ja'afar stood forth and told her what he had told the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,portress as they were entering the house; and when she heard his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,story of their being merchants and Mosul men who had outrun the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"watch, she said, I grant you your lives each for each sake, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,now away with you all. So they all went out and when they were
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in the street, quoth the Caliph to the Kalandars, O company,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whither go ye now, seeing that the morning hath not yet dawned?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth they, By Allah, O our lord, we know not where to go."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Come and pass the rest of the night with us, said the Caliph"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, turning to Ja'afar, Take them home with thee and tomorrow"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bring them to my presence that we may chronicle their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,adventures. Ja'afar did as the Caliph bade him and the Commander
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the Faithful returned to his palace; but sleep gave no sign of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,visiting him that night and he lay awake pondering the mishaps of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the three Kalandar princes and impatient to know the history of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the ladies and the two black bitches. No sooner had morning
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dawned than he went forth and sat upon the throne of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sovereignty; and, turning to Ja'afar, after all his Grandees and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Officers of state were gathered together, he said, Bring me the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,three ladies and the two bitches and the three Kalandars. So
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ja'afar fared forth and brought them all before him (and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ladies were veiled); then the Minister turned to them and said in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Caliph's name, We pardon you your maltreatment of us and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"your want of courtesy, in consideration of the kindness which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forewent it, and for that ye knew us not: now however I would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have you to know that ye stand in presence of the fifth[FN#301]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the sons of Abbas, Harun al-Rashid, brother of Caliph Músá al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hádi, son of Al-Mansúr; son of Mohammed the brother of Al-Saffáh"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bin Mohammed who was first of the royal house. Speak ye therefore
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before him the truth and the whole truth! When the ladies heard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ja afar's words touching the Commander of the Faithful, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eldest came forward and said, O Prince of True Believers, my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"story is one which, were it graven with needle-gravers upon the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eye corners were a warner for whoso would be warned and an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,example for whoso can take profit from example.--And Shahrazad
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"               When it was the Seventeenth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that she stood"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth before the Commander of the Faithful and began to tell
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Eldest Lady's Tale.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Verily a strange tale is mine and 'tis this:--Yon two black
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bitches are my eldest sisters by one mother and father; and these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"two others, she who beareth upon her the signs of stripes and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,third our procuratrix are my sisters by another mother. When my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"father died, each took her share of the heritage and, after a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"while my mother also deceased, leaving me and my sisters german"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,three thousand diners; so each daughter received her portion of a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thousand diners and I the same, albe the youngest. In due course"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of time my sisters married with the usual festivities and lived
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with their husbands, who bought merchandise with their wives"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,monies and set out on their travels together. Thus they threw me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"off. My brothers in law were absent with their wives five years,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"during which period they spent all the money they had and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"becoming bankrupt, deserted my sisters in foreign parts amid"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stranger folk. After five years my eldest sister returned to me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in beggar's gear with her clothes in rags and tatters[FN#302] and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a dirty old mantilla;[FN#303] and truly she was in the foulest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and sorriest plight. At first sight I did not know my own sister;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but presently I recognised her and said What state is this? O
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"our sister, she replied, Words cannot undo the done; and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,reed of Destiny hath run through what Allah decreed. Then I sent
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her to the bath and dressed her in a suit of mine own, and boiled"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for her a bouillon and brought her some good wine and said to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, O my sister, thou art the eldest, who still standest to us"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in the stead of father and mother; and, as for the inheritance"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which came to me as to you twain, Allah hath blessed it and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prospered it to me with increase; and my circumstances are easy,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for I have made much money by spinning and cleaning silk; and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and you will share my wealth alike. I entreated her with all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kindliness and she abode with me a whole year, during which our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thoughts and fancies were always full of our other sister. Shortly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after she too came home in yet fouler and sorrier plight than
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that of my eldest sister; and I dealt by her still more honorably
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than I had done by the first, and each of them had a share of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"substance. After a time they said to me, 'O our sister, we desire"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to marry again, for indeed we have not patience to drag on our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,days without husbands and to lead the lives of widows bewitched;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I replied, O eyes of me![FN#304] ye have hitherto seen"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"scanty weal in wedlock, for now-a-days good men and true are"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,become rarities and curiosities; nor do I deem your projects
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"advisable, as ye have already made trial of matrimony and have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,failed. But they would not accept my advice and married without
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my consent: nevertheless I gave them outfit and dowries out of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,money; and they fared forth with their mates. In a mighty little
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"time their husbands played them false and, taking whatever they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"could lay hands upon, levanted and left them in the lurch."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thereupon they came to me ashamed and in abject case and made
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their excuses to me, saying, Pardon our fault and be not wroth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with us;[FN#305] for although thou art younger in years yet art
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou older in wit; henceforth we will never make mention of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,marriage; so take us back as thy hand maidens that we may eat our
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mouthful. Quoth I, Welcome to you, O my sisters, there is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,naught dearer to me than you. And I took them in and redoubled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my kindness to them. We ceased not to live after this loving
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fashion for a full year, when I resolved to sell my wares abroad"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and first to fit me a conveyance for Bassorah; so I equipped a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"large ship, and loaded her with merchandise and valuable goods"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for traffic, and with provaunt and all needful for a voyage, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to my sisters, Will ye abide at home whilst I travel, or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would ye prefer to accompany me on the voyage? We will travel
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with thee, answered they, for we cannot bear to be parted from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee. So I divided my monies into two parts, one to accompany me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the other to be left in charge of a trusty person, for, as I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to myself, Haply some accident may happen to the ship and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,yet we remain alive; in which case we shall find on our return
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what may stand us in good stead. I took my two sisters and we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went a voyaging some days and nights; but the master was careless
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"enough to miss his course, and the ship went astray with us and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,entered a sea other than the sea we sought. For a time we knew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"naught of this; and the wind blew fair for us ten days, after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which the look out man went aloft to see about him and cried,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Good news! Then he came down rejoicing and said, I have seen"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what seemeth to be a city as 'twere a pigeon. Hereat we rejoiced
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, ere an hour of the day had passed, the buildings showed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"plain in the offing and we asked the Captain, What is the name"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of yonder city? and he answered By Allah I wot not, for I never"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw it before and never sailed these seas in my life: but, since"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"our troubles have ended in safety, remains for you only to land"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there with your merchandise and, if you find selling profitable,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sell and make your market of what is there; and if not, we will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rest here two days and provision ourselves and fare away. So we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,entered the port and the Captain went up town and was absent
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"awhile, after which he returned to us and said, Arise; go up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,into the city and marvel at the works of Allah with His creatures
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and pray to be preserved from His righteous wrath! So we landed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and going up into the city, saw at the gate men hending staves in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hand; but when we drew near them, behold, they had been"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,translated[FN#306] by the anger of Allah and had become stones.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then we entered the city and found all who therein woned into
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,black stones enstoned: not an inhabited house appeared to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"espier, nor was there a blower of fire.[FN#307] We were awe"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,struck at the sight and threaded the market streets where we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,found the goods and gold and silver left lying in their places;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and we were glad and said, Doubtless there is some mystery in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all this. Then we dispersed about the thorough-fares and each
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,busied himself with collecting the wealth and money and rich
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stuffs, taking scanty heed of friend or comrade. As for myself I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went up to the castle which was strongly fortified; and, entering"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King's palace by its gate of red gold, found all the vaiselle"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of gold and silver, and the King himself seated in the midst of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his Chamberlains and Nabobs and Emirs and Wazirs; all clad in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,raiment which confounded man's art. I drew nearer and saw him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sitting on a throne incrusted and inlaid with pearls and gems;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and his robes were of gold-cloth adorned with jewels of every
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kind, each one flashing like a star. Around him stood fifty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Mamelukes, white slaves, clothed in silks of divers sorts holding"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their drawn swords in their hands; but when I drew near to them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lo! all were black stones. My understanding was confounded at the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sight, but I walked on and entered the great hall of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Harim,[FN#308] whose walls I found hung with tapestries of gold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,striped silk and spread with silken carpets embroidered with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,golden cowers. Here I saw the Queen lying at full length arrayed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in robes purfled with fresh young[FN#309] pearls; on her head was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a diadem set with many sorts of gems each fit for a ring[FN#310]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and around her neck hung collars and necklaces. All her raiment
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and her ornaments were in natural state but she had been turned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,into a black stone by Allah's wrath. Presently I espied an open
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,door for which I made straight and found leading to it a flight
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of seven steps. So I walked up and came upon a place pargetted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with marble and spread and hung with gold-worked carpets and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tapestry, amiddlemostof which stood a throne of juniper wood"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,inlaid with pearls and precious stones and set with bosses of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"emeralds. In the further wall was an alcove whose curtains,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bestrung with pearls, were let down and I saw a light issuing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,therefrom; so I drew near and perceived that the light came from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a precious stone as big as an ostrich egg, set at the upper end"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the alcove upon a little chryselephantine couch of ivory and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gold; and this jewel, blazing like the sun, cast its rays wide"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and side. The couch also was spread with all manner of silken
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stuffs amazing the gazer with their richness and beauty. I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marvelled much at all this, especially when seeing in that place"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"candles ready lighted; and I said in my mind, Needs must some"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one have lighted these candles. Then I went forth and came to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the kitchen and thence to the buttery and the King's treasure
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chambers; and continued to explore the palace and to pace from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,place to place; I forgot myself in my awe and marvel at these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,matters and I was drowned in thought till the night came on. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I would have gone forth, but knowing not the gate I lost my way,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so I returned to the alcove whither the lighted candles directed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me and sat down upon the couch; and wrapping myself in a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"coverlet, after I had repeated somewhat from the Koran, I would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have slept but could not, for restlessness possessed me. When"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,night was at its noon I heard a voice chanting the Koran in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sweetest accents; but the tone thereof was weak; so I rose, glad"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to hear the silence broken, and followed the sound until I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,reached a closet whose door stood ajar. Then peeping through a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chink I considered the place and lo! it was an oratory wherein
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was a prayer niche[FN#311] with two wax candles burning and lamps
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hanging from the ceiling. In it too was spread a prayer carpet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whereupon sat a youth fair to see; and before him on its
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stand[FN#312] was a copy of the Koran, from which he was reading."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I marvelled to see him alone alive amongst the people of the city
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and entering saluted him; whereupon he raised his eyes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned my salam. Quoth I, Now by the Truth of what thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"readest in Allah's Holy Book, I conjure thee to answer my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"question. He looked upon me with a smile and said, O handmaid"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of Allah, first tell me the cause of thy coming hither, and I in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,turn will tell what hath befallen both me and the people of this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"city, and what was the reason of my escaping their doom. So I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,told him my story whereat he wondered; and I questioned him of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the people of the city, when he replied, Have patience with me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for a while, O my sister! and, reverently closing the Holy Book,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he laid it up in a satin bag. Then he seated me by his side; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I looked at him and behold, he was as the moon at its full, fair"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of face and rare of form, soft sided and slight, of well"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"proportioned height, and cheek smoothly bright and diffusing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"light; in brief a sweet, a sugar stick,[FN#313]. even as saith"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the poet of the like of him in these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"That night th' astrologer a scheme of planets drew, * And lo! a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     graceful shape of youth appeared in view:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Saturn had stained his locks with Saturninest jet, * And spots of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     nut brown musk on rosy side face blew:[FN#314]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Mars tinctured either cheek with tinct of martial red; * Sagittal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     shots from eyelids Sagittarius threw:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Dowered him Mercury with bright mercurial wit; * Bore off the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Bear[FN#315] what all man's evil glances grew:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Amazed stood Astrophil to sight the marvel birth * When louted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     low the Moon at full to buss the Earth.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And of a truth Allah the Most High had robed him in the raiment
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of perfect grace and had purfled and fringed it with a cheek all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beauty and loveliness, even as the poet saith of such an one:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By his eyelids shedding perfume and his fine slim waist I swear,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     * By the shooting of his shafts barbed with sorcery passing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     rare;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By the softness of his sides,[FN#316] and glances' lingering"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     light, * And brow of dazzling day-tide ray and night within"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     his hair;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By his eyebrows which deny to who look upon them rest, * Now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     bidding now forbidding, ever dealing joy and care;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By the rose that decks his cheek, and the myrtle of its"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     moss,[FN#317] * By jacinths bedded in his lips and pearl his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     smile lays bare;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By his graceful bending neck and the curving of his breast, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Whose polished surface beareth those granados, lovely pair;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By his heavy hips that quiver as he passeth in his pride, * Or he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     resteth with that waist which is slim beyond compare;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By the satin of his skin, by that fine unsullied sprite; * By the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     beauty that containeth all things bright and debonnair;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,By that ever open hand; by the candour of his tongue; * By noble
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     blood and high degree whereof he's hope and heir;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Musk from him borrows muskiness she loveth to exhale * And all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     the airs of ambergris through him perfume the air;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The sun, methinks, the broad bright sun, before my love would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pale * And sans his splendour would appear a paring of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     nail.[FN#318]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I glanced at him with one glance of eyes which caused me a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thousand sighs; and my heart was at once taken captive wise, so I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asked him, O my lord and my love, tell me that whereof I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"questioned thee; and he answered, Hearing is obeying! Know O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"handmaid of Allah, that this city was the capital of my father"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who is the King thou sawest on the throne transfigured by Allah's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wrath to a black stone, and the Queen thou foundest in the alcove"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is my mother. They and all the people of the city were Magians
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who fire adored in lieu of the Omnipotent Lord[FN#319] and were
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wont to swear by lowe and heat and shade and light and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,spheres revolving day and night. My father had ne'er a son till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he was blest with me near the last of his days; and he reared me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till I grew up and prosperity anticipated me in all things. Now
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it so fortuned that there was with us an old woman well stricken
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in years, a Moslemah who, inwardly believing in Allah and His"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Apostle, conformed outwardly with the religion of my people; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my father placed thorough confidence in her for that he knew her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to be trustworthy and virtuous; and he treated her with ever
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,increasing kindness believing her to be of his own belief. So
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when I was well nigh grown up my father committed me to her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,charge saying:--Take him and educate him and teach him the rules
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of our faith; let him have the best in structions and cease not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy fostering care of him. So she took me and taught me the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tenets of Al-Islam with the divine ordinances[FN#320] of the Wuzu
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ablution and the five daily prayers and she made me learn the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Koran by rote, often repeating:--Serve none save Allah Almighty!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When I had mastered this much of knowledge she said to me:--O my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son, keep this matter concealed from thy sire and reveal naught"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to him lest he slay thee. So I hid it from him and I abode on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this wise for a term of days when the old woman died, and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,people of the city redoubled in their impiety[FN#321] and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arrogance and the error of their ways. One day, while they were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as wont, behold, they heard a loud and terrible sound and a crier"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,crying out with a voice like roaring thunder so every ear could
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hear, far and near, O folk of this city, leave ye your fire"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"worshipping and adore Allah the All-compassionate King! At this,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fear and terror fell upon the citizens and they crowded to my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"father (he being King of the city) and asked him, What is this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"awesome voice we have heard, for it hath confounded us with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"excess of its terror? and he answered, Let not a voice fright"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,you nor shake your steadfast sprite nor turn you back from the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,faith which is right. Their hearts inclined to his words and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they ceased not to worship the fire and they persisted in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rebellion for a full year from the time they heard the first
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"voice; and on the anniversary came a second cry, and a third at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the head of the third year, each year once Still they persisted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in their malpractises till one day at break of dawn, judgment and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the wrath of Heaven descended upon them with all suddenness, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,by the visitation of Allah all were metamorphosed into black
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stones,[FN#322] they and their beasts and their cattle; and none"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was saved save myself who at the time was engaged in my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"devotions. From that day to this I am in the case thou seest,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,constant in prayer and fasting and reading and reciting the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Koran; but I am indeed grown weary by reason of my loneliness,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,having none to bear me company. Then said I to him (for in very
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sooth he had won my heart and was the lord of my life and soul),"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O youth, wilt thou fare with me to Baghdad city and visit the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Olema and men learned in the law and doctors of divinity and get
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee increase of wisdom and understanding and theology? And know
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that she who standeth in thy presence will be thy handmaid,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,albeit she be head of her family and mistress over men and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eunuchs and servants and slaves Indeed my life was no life before
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it fell in with thy youth. I have here a ship laden with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,merchandise; and in very truth Destiny drove me to this city that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I might come to the knowledge of these matters, for it was fated"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that we should meet. And I ceased not to persuade him and speak
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him fair and use every art till he consented.--And Shahrazad
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"               When it was the Eighteenth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lady ceased not persuading with soft speech the youth to depart
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with her till he consented and said Yes. She slept that night
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lying at his feet and hardly knowing where she was for excess of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"joy. As soon as the next morning dawned (she pursued, addressing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Caliph), I arose and we entered the treasuries and took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thence whatever was light in weight and great in worth; then we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went down side by side from the castle to the city, where we were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,met by the Captain and my sisters and slaves who had been seeking
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for me. When they saw me they rejoiced and asked what had stayed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, and I told them all I had seen and related to them the story"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the young Prince and the transformation wherewith the citizens
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had been justly visited. Hereat all marvelled, but when my two"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sisters (these two bitches, O Commander of the Faithful!) saw me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,by the side of my young lover they jaloused me on his account and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,were wroth and plotted mischief against me. We awaited a fair
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wind and went on board rejoicing and ready to fly for joy by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reason of the goods we had gotten, but my own greatest joyance"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was in the youth; and we waited awhile till the wind blew fair for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us and then we set sail and fared forth. Now as we sat talking,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my sisters asked me, And what wilt thou do with this handsome"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young man?; and I answered, I purpose to make him my husband!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then I turned to him and said, O my lord, I have that to propose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to thee wherein thou must not cross me; and this it is that, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"we reach Baghdad, my native city, I offer thee my life as thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"handmaiden in holy matrimony, and thou shalt be to me baron and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will be femme to thee. He answered, I hear and I obey!; thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,art my lady and my mistress and whatso thou doest I will not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gainsay. Then I turned to my sisters and said, This is my gain;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I content me with this youth and those who have gotten aught of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my property let them keep it as their gain with my good will.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou sayest and doest well, answered the twain, but they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,imagined mischief against me. We ceased not spooning before a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fair wind till we had exchanged the sea of peril for the seas of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"safety and, in a few days, we made Bassorah city, whose buildings"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loomed clear before us as evening fell. But after we had retired
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to rest and were sound alseep, my two sisters arose and took me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"up, bed and all, and threw me into the sea: they did the same"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with the young Prince who, as he could not swim, sank and was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drowned and Allah enrolled him in the noble army of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Martyrs.[FN#323] As for me would Heaven I had been drowned with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, but Allah deemed that I should be of the saved; so when I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,awoke and found myself in the sea and saw the ship making off
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like a dash of lightning, He threw in my way a piece of timber"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which I bestrided, and the waves tossed me to and fro till they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cast me upon an island coast, a high land and an uninhabited. I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"landed and walked about the island the rest of the night and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when morning dawned, I saw a rough track barely fit for child of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Adam to tread, leading to what proved a shallow ford connecting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,island and mainland. As soon as the sun had risen I spread my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,garments to dry in its rays; and ate of the fruits of the island
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and drank of its waters; then I set out along the foot track and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ceased not walking till I reached the mainland. Now when there
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"remained between me and the city but a two hours' journey behold,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a great serpent, the bigness of a date palm, came fleeing towards"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me in all haste, gliding along now to the right then to the left"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till she was close upon me, whilst her tongue lolled ground wards"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a span long and swept the dust as she went. She was pursued by a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Dragon[FN#324] who was not longer than two lances, and of slender"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"build about the bulk of a spear and, although her terror lent her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"speed, and she kept wriggling from side to side, he overtook her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and seized her by the tail, whereat her tears streamed down and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her tongue was thrust out in her agony. I took pity on her and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"picking up a stone and calling upon Allah for aid, threw it at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Dragon's head with such force that he died then and there;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the serpent opening a pair of wings flew into the lift and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disappeared from before my eyes. I sat down marvelling over that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"adventure, but I was weary and, drowsiness overcoming me, I slept"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where I was for a while. When I awoke I found a jet black damsel
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sitting at my feet shampooing them; and by her side stood two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"black bitches (my sisters, O Commander of the Faithful!). I was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ashamed before her[FN#325] and, sitting up, asked her, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sister, who and what art thou?; and she answered, How soon hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou forgotten me! I am she for whom thou wroughtest a good deed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and sowedest the seed of gratitude and slewest her foe; for I am
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the serpent whom by Allah's aidance thou didst just now deliver
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from the Dragon. I am a Jinniyah and he was a Jinn who hated me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and none saved my life from him save thou. As soon as thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,freedest me from him I flew on the wind to the ship whence thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sisters threw thee, and removed all that was therein to thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,house. Then I ordered my attendant Marids to sink the ship and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,transformed thy two sisters into these black bitches; for I know
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all that hath passed between them and thee; but as for the youth,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of a truth he is drowned. So saying, she flew up with me and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bitches, and presently set us down on the terrace roof of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house, wherein I found ready stored the whole of what property"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was in my ship, nor was aught of it missing. Now (continued the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"serpent that was), I swear by all engraver on the seal-ring of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Solomon[FN#326] (with whom be peace!) unless thou deal to each of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these bitches three hundred stripes every day I will come and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"imprison thee forever under the earth. I answered, Hearkening"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and obedience!; and away she flew. But before going she again
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"charged me saying, I again swear by Him who made the two seas"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,flow[FN#327] (and this be my second oath) if thou gainsay me I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will come and transform thee like thy sisters. Since then I have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"never failed, O Commander of the Faithful, to beat them with that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"number of blows till their blood flows with my tears, I pitying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them the while, and well they wot that their being scourged is no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fault of mine and they accept my excuses. And this is my tale and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my history! The Caliph marvelled at her adventures and then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"signed to Ja'afar who said to the second lady, the Portress, And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou, how camest thou by the welts and wheels upon thy body? So"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she began the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Tale of the Portress.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O Commander of the Faithful, that I had a father who, after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fulfilling his time, deceased and left me great store of wealth."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I remained single for a short time and presently married one of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the richest of his day. I abode with him a year when he also
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"died, and my share of his property amounted to eighty thousand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,diners in gold according to the holy law of inheritance.[FN#328]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thus I became passing rich an my reputation spread far and wide,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for I had made me ten changes of raiment, each worth a thousand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"diners One day as I was sitting at home, behold, there came in to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me an old woman[FN#329] with lantern jaws and cheeks sucked in,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and eyes rucked up, and eyebrows scant and scald, and head bare"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and bald; and teeth broken by time and mauled, and back bending"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and neck nape nodding, and face blotched, and rheum running, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hair like a snake black and white speckled, in complexion a very"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fright, even as saith the poet of the like of her:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ill-omened hag! unshriven be her sins * Nor mercy visit her on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     dying bed:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thousand head strongest he mules would her guiles, * Despite"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     their bolting lead with spider thread.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And as saith another:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,A hag to whom th' unlawful lawfullest * And witchcraft wisdom in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     her sight are grown:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"A mischief making brat, a demon maid, * A whorish woman and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pimping crone.[FN#330]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the old woman entered she salamed to me and kissing the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ground before me, said, I have at home an orphan daughter and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this night are her wedding and her displaying.[FN#331] We be poor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,folks and strangers in this city knowing none inhabitant and we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,are broken hearted. So do thou earn for thyself a recompense and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a reward in Heaven by being present at her displaying and, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the ladies of this city shall hear that thou art to make act of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"presence, they also will present themselves; so shalt thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"comfort her affliction, for she is sore bruised in spirit and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hath none to look to save Allah the Most High. Then she wept and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kissed my feet reciting these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thy presence bringeth us a grace * We own before thy winsome
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     face:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And wert thou absent ne'er an one * Could stand in stead or take
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thy place.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So pity get hold on me and compassion and I said, Hearing is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"consenting and, please Allah, I will do somewhat more for her;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nor shall she be shown to her bridegroom save in my raiment and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ornaments and jewelry. At this the old woman rejoiced and bowed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her head to my feet and kissed them, saying, Allah requite thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"weal, and comfort thy heart even as thou hast comforted mine!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But, O my lady, do not trouble thyself to do me this service at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this hour; be thou ready by supper time,[FN#332] when I will come"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and fetch thee. So saying she kissed my hand and went her ways.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I set about stringing my pearls and donning my brocades and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,making my toilette. Little recking what Fortune had in womb for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, when suddenly the old woman stood before me, simpering and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"smiling till she showed every tooth stump, and quoth she, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mistress, the city madams have arrived and when I apprized them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that thou promisedst to be present, they were glad and they are"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,now awaiting thee and looking eagerly for thy coming and for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"honour of meeting thee. So I threw on my mantilla and, making"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the old crone walk before me and my handmaidens behind me, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fared till we came to a street well watered and swept neat, where"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the winnowing breeze blew cool and sweet. Here we were stopped by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a gate arched over with a dome of marble stone firmly seated on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"solidest foundation, and leading to a Palace whose walls from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"earth rose tall and proud, and whose pinnacle was crowned by the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clouds,[FN#333] and over the doorway were writ these couplets:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I am the wone where Mirth shall ever smile; * The home of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Joyance through my lasting while:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And 'mid my court a fountain jets and flows, * Nor tears nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     troubles shall that fount defile:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The merge with royal Nu'uman's[FN#334] bloom is dight, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Myrtle, Narcissus-flower and Chamomile."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Arrived at the gate, before which hung a black curtain, the old"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,woman knocked and it was opened to us; when we entered and found
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a vestibule spread with carpets and hung around with lamps all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,alight and wax candles in candelabra adorned with pendants of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,precious gems and noble ores. We passed on through this passage
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till we entered a saloon, whose like for grandeur and beauty is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not to be found in this world. It was hung and carpeted with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"silken stuffs, and was illuminated with branches sconces and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tapers ranged in double row, an avenue abutting on the upper or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"noble end of the saloon, where stood a couch of juniper wood"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,encrusted with pearls and gems and surmounted by a baldaquin with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mosquito curtains of satin looped up with margaritas. And hardly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had we taken note of this when there came forth from the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"baldaquin a young lady and I looked, O Commander of the Faithful,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon a face and form more perfect than the moon when fullest,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with a favour brighter than the dawn gleaming with saffron-hued
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"light, even as the poet sang when he said--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou pacest the palace a marvel sight, * A bride for a Kisra's or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Kaisar's night!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wantons the rose on thy roseate cheek, * O cheek as the blood of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     the dragon[FN#335] bright!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Slim waisted, languorous, sleepy eyed, * With charms which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     promise all love
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And the tire which attires thy tiara'd brow * Is a night of woe
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     on a morn's glad light.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The fair young girl came down from the estrade and said to me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Welcome and well come and good cheer to my sister, the dearly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beloved, the illustrious, and a thousand greetings! Then she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,recited these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"An but the house could know who cometh 'twould rejoice, * And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     kiss the very dust whereon thy foot was placed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And with the tongue of circumstance the walls would say, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Welcome and hail to one with generous gifts engraced!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then sat she down and said to me, O my sister, I have a brother"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who hath had sight of thee at sundry wedding feasts and festive
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seasons: he is a youth handsomer than I, and he hath fallen"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"desperately in love with thee, for that bounteous Destiny hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,garnered in thee all beauty and perfection; and he hath given
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,silver to this old woman that she might visit thee; and she hath
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,contrived on this wise to foregather us twain. He hath heard that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou art one of the nobles of thy tribe nor is he aught less in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his; and, being desirous to ally his lot with thy lot, he hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,practiced this device to bring me in company with thee; for he is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fain to marry thee after the ordinance of Allah and his Apostle;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and in what is lawful and right there is no shame. When I heard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"these words and saw myself fairly entrapped in the house, I said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hearing is consenting. She was delighted at this and clapped
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her hands;[FN#336] whereupon a door opened and out of it came a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young man blooming in the prime of life, exquisitely dressed, a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"model of beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with gentle winning manners and eyebrows like a bended bow and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shaft on cord, and eyes which bewitched all hearts with sorcery"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lawful in the sight of the Lord; even as saith some rhymer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,describing the like of him:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,His face as the face of the young moon shines * And Fortune
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     stamps him with pearls for signs.[FN#337]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And Allah favour him who said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Blest be his beauty; blest the Lord's decree * Who cast and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     shaped a thing so bright of blee:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,All gifts of beauty he conjoins in one; * Lost in his love is all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     humanity;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,For Beauty's self inscribed on his brow * I testify there be no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Good but he![FN#338]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When I looked at him my heart inclined to him and I loved him;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he sat by my side and talked with me a while, when the young"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady again clapped her hands and behold, a side door opened and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out of it came the Kazi with his four assessors as witnesses; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they saluted us and, sitting down, drew up and wrote out the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,marriage contract between me and the youth and retired. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"turned to me and said, Be our night blessed, presently adding,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my lady, I have a condition to lay on thee. Quoth I, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lord, what is that? Whereupon he arose and fetching a copy of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Holy Book presented it to me saying Swear hereon thou wilt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,never look at any other than myself nor incline thy body or thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heart to him. I swore readily enough to this and he joyed with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,exceeding joy and embraced me round the neck while love for him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,possessed my whole heart. Then they set the table[FN#339] before
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us and we ate and drank till we were satisfied, but I was dying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for the coming of the night. And when night did come he led me to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the bride chamber and slept with me on the bed and continued to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kiss and embrace me till the morning--such a night I had never
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seen in my dreams. I lived with him a life of happiness and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"delight for a full month, at the end of which I asked his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,leave[FN#340] to go on foot to the bazar and buy me certain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,especial stuffs and he gave me permission. So I donned my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mantilla and, taking with me the old woman and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slave-girl,[FN#341] I went to the khan of the silk-mercers, where"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I seated myself in the shop front of a young merchant whom the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"old woman recommended, saying to me, This youth's father died"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when he was a boy and left him great store of wealth: he hath by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him a mighty fine[FN#342] stock of goods and thou wilt find what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou seekest with him, for none in the bazar hath better stuffs"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than he. Then she said to him, Show this lady the most costly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stuffs thou hast by thee; and he replied, Hearkening and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"obedience! Then she whispered me, Say a civil word to him!;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but I replied, I am pledged to address no man save my lord. And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as she began to sound his praise I said sharply to her, We want"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nought of thy sweet speeches; our wish is to buy of him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whatsoever we need, and return home. So he brought me all I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sought and I offered him his money, but he refused to take it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, Let it be a gift offered to my guest this day! Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth I to the old woman, If he will not take the money, give"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him back his stuff. By Allah, cried he, not a thing will I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"take from thee: I sell it not for gold or for silver, but I give"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it all as a gift for a single kiss; a kiss more precious to me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than everything the shop containeth. Asked the old woman, What"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will the kiss profit thee?; and, turning to me, whispered, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter, thou hearest what this young fellow saith? What harm"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will it do thee if he get a kiss from thee and thou gettest what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou seekest at that price? Replied I, I take refuge with Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from such action! Knowest thou not that I am bound by an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"oath?''[FN#343] But she answered, Now whist! just let him kiss"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee and neither speak to him nor lean over him, so shalt thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"keep thine oath and thy silver, and no harm whatever shall befal"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee. And she ceased not to persuade me and importune me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,make light of the matter till evil entered into my mind and I put
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my head in the poke[FN#344] and, declaring I would ne'er consent,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,consented. So I veiled my eyes and held up the edge of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mantilla between me and the people passing and he put his mouth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to my cheek under the veil. But while kissing me he bit me so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hard a bite that it tore the flesh from my cheek,[FN#345] and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blood flowed fast and faintness came over me. The old woman
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"caught me in her arms and, when I came to myself, I found the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shop shut up and her sorrowing over me and saying, Thank Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for averting what might have been worse! Then she said to me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Come, take heart and let us go home before the matter become"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,public and thou be dishonoured. And when thou art safe inside the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,house feign sickness and lie down and cover thyself up; and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will bring thee powders and plasters to cure this bite withal,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and thy wound will be healed at the latest in three days. So
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after a while I arose and I was in extreme distress and terror
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came full upon me; but I went on little by little till I reached
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the house when I pleaded illness and lay me down. When it was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night my husband came in to me and said, What hath befallen"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee, O my darling, in this excursion of thine?; and I replied,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I am not well: my head acheth badly. Then he lighted a candle
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and drew near me and looked hard at me and asked, What is that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wound I see on thy cheek and in the tenderest part too? And I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, When I went out to day with thy leave to buy stuffs, a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,camel laden with firewood jostled me and one of the pieces tore
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my veil and wounded my cheek as thou seest; for indeed the ways
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of this city are strait. Tomorrow, cried he, I will go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"complain to the Governor, so shall he gibbet every fuel seller in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Baghdad. Allah upon thee, said I, burden not thy soul with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,such sin against any man. The fact is I was riding on an ass and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it stumbled, throwing me to the ground; and my cheek lighted upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a stick or a bit of glass and got this wound. Then, said he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tomorrow I will go up to Ja'afar the Barmaki and tell him the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"story, so shall he kill every donkey boy in Baghdad. Wouldst"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou destroy all these men because of my wound, said I, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this which befel me was by decree of Allah and His destiny? But
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he answered, There is no help for it; and, springing to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feet, plied me with words and pressed me till I was perplexed and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,frightened; and I stuttered and stammered and my speech waxed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thick and I said, This is a mere accident by decree of Allah."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then, O Commander of the Faithful, he guessed my case and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thou hast been false to thine oath. He at once cried out with a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loud cry, whereupon a door opened and in came seven black slaves"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whom he commanded to drag me from my bed and throw me down in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"middle of the room. Furthermore, he ordered one of them to pinion"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my elbows and squat upon my head; and a second to sit upon my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,knees and secure my feet; and drawing his sword he gave it to a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"third and said, Strike her, O Sa'ad, and cut her in twain and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,let each one take half and cast it into the Tigris[FN#346] that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the fish may eat her; for such is the retribution due to those
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who violate their vows and are unfaithful to their love. And he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,redoubled in wrath and recited these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"An there be one who shares with me her love, * I'd strangle Love"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     tho' life by Love were slain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Saying, O Soul, Death were the nobler choice, * For ill is Love"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     when shared 'twixt partners twain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he repeated to the slave, Smite her, O Sa'ad! And when the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slave who was sitting upon me made sure of the command he bent
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"down to me and said, O my mistress, repeat the profession of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Faith and bethink thee if there be any thing thou wouldst have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,done; for verily this is the last hour of thy life. O good
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slave, said I, wait but a little while and get off my head that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I may charge thee with my last injunctions. Then I raised my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"head and saw the state I was in, how I had fallen from high"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,degree into lowest disgrace; and into death after life (and such
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,life!) and how I had brought my punishment on myself by my own
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sin; where upon the tears streamed from mine eyes and I wept with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceed ing weeping. But he looked on me with eyes of wrath, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,began repeating:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tell her who turneth from our love to work it injury sore, * And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     taketh her a fine new love the old love tossing o'er:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,We cry enough o' thee ere thou enough of us shalt cry! * What
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     past between us cloth suffice and haply something
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     more.[FN#347]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I heard this, O Commander of the Faithful, I wept and looked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at him and began repeating these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,To severance you doom my love and all unmoved remain; * My
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     tear sore lids you sleepless make and sleep while I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     complain:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,You make firm friendship reign between mine eyes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"    insomny; * Yet can my heart forget you not, nor tears can I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,    restrain:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,You made me swear with many an oath my troth to hold for aye; *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     But when you reigned my bosom's lord you wrought me traitor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bane:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I loved you like a silly child who wots not what is Love; * Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     spare the learner, let her not be by the master slain!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah's name I pray you write, when I am dead and gone, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Upon my tomb, This died of Love whose senses Love had ta'en:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then haply one shall pass that way who fire of Love hath felt, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     And treading on a lover's heart with ruth and woe shall
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     melt.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When I ended my verses tears came again; but the poetry and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"weeping only added fury to his fury, and he recited:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Twas not satiety bade me leave the dearling of my soul, * But"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     that she sinned a mortal sin which clips me in its clip:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She sought to let another share the love between us twain, * But"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     my True Faith of Unity refuseth partnership.[FN#348]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When he ceased reciting I wept again and prayed his pardon and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"humbled myself before him and spoke him softly, saying to myself,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I will work on him with words; so haply he will refrain from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slaying me, even though he take all I have. So I complained of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my sufferings and began to repeat these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now, by thy life and wert thou just my life thou hadst not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     ta'en, * But who can break the severance law which parteth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     lovers twain!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou loadest me with heavy weight of longing love, when I * Can"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     hardly bear my chemisette for weakness and for pain:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I marvel not to see my life and soul in ruin lain: * I marvel
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     much to see my frame such severance pangs sustain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When I ended my verse I wept again; and he looked at me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reviled me in abusive language,[FN#349] repeating these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou wast all taken up with love of other man, not me; * 'Twas"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     thine to show me severance face, ''twas only mine to see:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I'll leave thee for that first thou wert of me to take thy leave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     * And patient bear that parting blow thou borest so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     patiently:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"E'en as thou soughtest other love, so other love I'll seek, * And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     make the crime of murdering love thine own atrocity.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When he had ended his verses he again cried out to the slave,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Cut her in half and free us from her, for we have no profit of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her. So the slave drew near me, O Commander of the Faithful and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ceased bandying verses and made sure of death and, despairing of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"life, committed my affairs to Almighty Allah, when behold, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,old woman rushed in and threw herself at my husband's feet and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kissed them and wept and said, O my son, by the rights of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fosterage and by my long service to thee, I conjure thee pardon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this young lady, for indeed she hath done nothing deserving such"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,doom. Thou art a very young man and I fear lest her death be laid
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at thy door; for it is said:--Whoso slayeth shall be slain. As
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for this wanton (since thou deemest her such) drive her out from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy doors, from thy love and from thy heart. And she ceased not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to weep and importune him till he relented and said, 'I pardon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, but needs must I set on her my mark which shall show upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her all my life. Then he bade the slaves drag me along the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ground and lay me out at full length, after stripping me of all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my clothes;[FN#350] and when the slaves had so sat upon me that I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"could not move, he fetched in a rod of quince tree and came down"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with it upon my body, and continued beating me on the back and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sides till I lost consciousness from excess of pain, and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,despaired of life. Then he commanded the slaves to take me away
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as soon as it was dark, together with the old woman to show them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the way and throw me upon the floor of the house wherein I dwelt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before my marriage. They did their lord's bidding and cast me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down in my old home and went their ways. I did not revive from my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"swoon till dawn appeared, when I applied myself to the dressing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of my wounds with ointments and other medicaments; and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"medicined myself, but my sides and ribs still showed signs of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rod as thou hast seen. I lay in weakly case and confined to my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bed for four months before I was able to rise and health returned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to me. At the end of that time I went to the house where all this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had happened and found it a ruin; the street had been pulled down
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,endlong and rubbish heaps rose where the building erst was; nor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,could I learn how this had come about. Then I betook myself to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this my sister on my father's side and found her with these two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,black bitches. I saluted her and told her what had betided me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the whole of my story and she said, O my sister, who is safe"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from the despite of Time and secure? Thanks be to Allah who has
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brought thee off safely; and she began to say:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Such is the World, so bear a patient heart * When riches leave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thee and when friends depart!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then she told me her own story, and what had happened to her with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her two sisters and how matters had ended; so we abode together
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the subject of marriage was never on our tongues for all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"these years. After a while we were joined by our other sister,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the procuratrix, who goeth out every morning and buyeth all we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,require for the day and night; and we continued in such condition
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till this last night. In the morning our sister went out, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"usual, to make her market and then befel us what befel from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bringing the Porter into the house and admitting these three
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Kalandar men., We entreated them kindly and honourably and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,quarter of the night had not passed ere three grave and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,respectable merchants from Mosul joined us and told us their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,adventures. We sat talking with them but on one condition which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they violated, whereupon we treated them as sorted with their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"breach of promise, and made them repeat the account they had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,given of themselves. They did our bidding and we forgave their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,offence; so they departed from us and this morning we were
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,unexpectedly summoned to thy presence. And such is our story! The
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Caliph wondered at her words and bade the tale be recorded and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chronicled and laid up in his muniment-chambers.--And Shahrazad
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"               When it was the Nineteenth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Caliph commanded this story and those of the sister and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Kalandars to be recorded in the archives and be set in the royal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"muniment-chambers. Then he asked the eldest lady, the mistress of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the house, Knowest thou the whereabouts of the Ifritah who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spelled thy sisters?; and she answered, O Commander of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Faithful, she gave me a ringlet of her hair saying: --Whenas thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wouldest see me, burn a couple of these hairs and I will be with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee forthright, even though I were beyond Caucasus-mountain."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth the Caliph, Bring me hither the hair. So she brought it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he threw the whole lock upon the fire. As soon as the odour of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the burning hair dispread itself, the palace shook and trembled,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and all present heard a rumbling and rolling of thunder and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,noise as of wings and lo! the Jinniyah who had been a serpent
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stood in the Caliph's presence. Now she was a Moslemah, so she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saluted him and said, Peace be with thee O Vicar[FN#351] of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah; whereto he replied, And with thee also be peace and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mercy of Allah and His blessing. Then she continued, Know that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this damsel sowed for me the seed of kindness, wherefor I cannot"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"enough requite her, in that she delivered me from death and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,destroyed mine enemy. Now I had seen how her sisters dealt with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her and felt myself bound to avenge her on them. At first I was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"minded to slay them, but I feared it would be grievous to her, so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I transformed them to bitches; but if thou desire their release,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O Commander of the Faithful, I will release them to pleasure thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and her for I am of the Moslems. Quoth the Caliph, Release them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and after we will look into the affair of the beaten lady and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,consider her case carefully; and if the truth of her story be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,evidenced I will exact retaliation[FN#352] from him who wronged
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her. Said the Ifritah, O Commander of the Faithful, I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forthwith release them and will discover to thee the man who did
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that deed by this lady and wronged her and took her property, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he is the nearest of all men to thee! So saying she took a cup
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of water and muttered a spell over it and uttered words there was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,no understanding; then she sprinkled some of the water over the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"faces of the two bitches, saying, Return to your former human"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shape! whereupon they were restored to their natural forms and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell to praising their Creator. Then said the Ifritah, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Commander of the Faithful, of a truth he who scourged this lady"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with rods is thy son Al-Amin brother of Al-Maamun ;[FN#353] for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he had heard of her beauty and love liness and he played a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lover's stratagem with her and married her according to the law
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and committed the crime (such as it is) of scourging her. Yet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"indeed he is not to be blamed for beating her, for he laid a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,condition on her and swore her by a solemn oath not to do a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"certain thing; however, she was false to her vow and he was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"minded to put her to death, but he feared Almighty Allah and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"contented himself with scourging her, as thou hast seen, and with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sending her back to her own place. Such is the story of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,second lady and the Lord knoweth all. When the Caliph heard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"these words of the Ifritah, and knew who had beaten the damsel,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he marvelled with mighty marvel and said, Praise be to Allah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Most High, the Almighty, who hath shown his exceeding mercy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"towards me, enabling me to deliver these two damsels from sorcery"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and torture, and vouchsafing to let me know the secret of this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady's history! And now by Allah, we will do a deed which shall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be recorded of us after we are no more. Then he summoned his son
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Al-Amin and questioned him of the story of the second lady, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,portress; and he told it in the face of truth; whereupon the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Caliph bade call into presence the Kazis and their witnesses and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the three Kalandars and the first lady with her sisters german
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who had been ensorcelled; and he married the three to the three
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Kalandars whom he knew to be princes and sons of Kings and he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"appointed them chamberlains about his person, assigning to them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stipends and allowances and all that they required, and lodging"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them in his palace at Baghdad. He returned the beaten lady to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son, Al-Amin, renewing the marriage contract between them and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gave her great wealth and bade rebuild the house fairer than it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was before. As for himself he took to wife the procuratrix and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lay with her that night: and next day he set apart for her an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"apartment in his Serraglio, with handmaidens for her service and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a fixed daily allowance. And the people marvelled at their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Caliph's generosity and natural beneficence and princely widsom;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nor did he forget to send all these histories to be recorded in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his annals. When Shahrazad ceased speaking Dunyazad exclaimed, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my own sister, by Allah in very sooth this is a right pleasant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tale and a delectable; never was heard the like of it, but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,prithee tell me now another story to while away what yet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"remaineth of the waking hours of this our night. She replied,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"With love and gladness if the King give me leave; and he said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tell thy tale and tell it quickly. So she began, in these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"words,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,                  THE TALE OF THE THREE APPLES
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"They relate, O King of the age and lord of the time and of these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"days, that the Caliph Harun al-Rashid summoned his Wazir Ja'afar"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one night and said to him, 'I desire to go down into the city and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,question the common folk concerning the conduct of those charged
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with its governance; and those of whom they complain we will
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,depose from office and those whom they commend we will promote.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth Ja'afar, Hearkening and obedience! So the Caliph went"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down with Ja'afar and Eunuch Masrur to the town and walked about
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the streets and markets and, as they were threading a narrow"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"alley, they came upon a very old man with a fishing-net and crate"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to carry small fish on his head, and in his hand a staff; and, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he walked at a leisurely pace, he repeated these lines:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,They say me: --Thou shinest a light to mankind * With thy lore
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     as the night which the Moon doth uplight!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I answer, A truce to your jests and your gibes; * Without luck"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     what is learning?--a poor-devil wight!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If they take me to pawn with my lore in my pouch, * With my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     volumes to read and my ink-case to write,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,For one day's provision they never could pledge me; * As likely
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     on Doomsday to draw bill at sight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"How poorly, indeed, doth it fare wi' the poor, * With his pauper"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     existence and beggarly plight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,In summer he faileth provision to find; * In winter the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fire-pot's his only delight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The street-dogs with bite and with bark to him rise, * And each"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     losel receives him with bark and with bite:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If he lift up his voice and complain of his wrong, * None pities"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     or heeds him, however he's right;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And when sorrows and evils like these he must brave * His
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     happiest homestead were down in the grave.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When the Caliph heard his verses he said to Ja'afar, See this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"poor man and note his verses, for surely they point to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"necessities. Then he accosted him and asked, O Shaykh, what be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thine occupation? and the poor man answered, O my lord, I am a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fisherman with a family to keep and I have been out between
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mid-day and this time; and not a thing hath Allah made my portion
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wherewithal to feed my family. I cannot even pawn myself to buy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them a supper and I hate and disgust my life and I hanker after
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"death. Quoth the Caliph, Say me, wilt thou return with us to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tigris' bank and cast thy net on my luck, and whatsoever turneth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up I will buy of thee for an hundred gold pieces? The man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoiced when he heard these words and said, On my head be it! I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will go back with you; and, returning with them river-wards,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made a cast and waited a while; then he hauled in the rope and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dragged the net ashore and there appeared in it a chest padlocked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and heavy. The Caliph examined it and lifted it finding it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,weighty; so he gave the fisherman two hundred dinars and sent him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"about his business; whilst Masrur, aided by the Caliph, carried"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the chest to the palace and set it down and lighted the candles.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ja'afar and Masrur then broke it open and found therein a basket
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of palm-leaves corded with red worsted. This they cut open and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw within it a piece of carpet which they lifted out, and under"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it was a woman's mantilla folded in four, which they pulled out;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and at the bottom of the chest they came upon a young lady, fair"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as a silver ingot, slain and cut into nineteen pieces. When the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Caliph looked upon her he cried, Alas! and tears ran down his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cheeks and turning to Ja'afar he said, O dog of Wazirs, [FN#354]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shall folk be murdered in our reign and be cast into the river to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be a burden and a responsibility for us on the Day of Doom? By
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, we must avenge this woman on her murderer and he shall be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made die the worst of deaths! And presently he added,  Now, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"surely as we are descended from the Sons of Abbas, [FN#355] if"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou bring us not him who slew her, that we do her justice on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, I will hang thee at the gate of my palace, thee and forty of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy kith and kin by thy side. And the: Caliph was wroth with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding rage. Quoth Ja'afar, Grant me three days' delay; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth the Caliph, We grant thee this. So Ja'afar went out from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before him and returned to his own house, full of sorrow and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying to himself, How shall I find him who murdered this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"damsel, that I may bring him before the Caliph? If I bring other"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than the murderer, it will be laid to my charge by the Lord: in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,very sooth I wot not what to do. He kept his house three days
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and on the fourth day the Caliph sent one of the Chamberlains for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him and, as he came into the presence, asked him, Where is the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"murderer of the damsel? to which answered Ja'afar, O Commander"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the Faithful, am I inspector of  murdered folk that I should"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ken who killed her? The Caliph was furious at his answer and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bade hang him before the palace-gate and commanded that a crier
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cry through the streets of Baghdad, Whoso would see the hanging"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of Ja'afar, the Barmaki, Wazir of the Caliph, with forty of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Barmecides, [FN#356] his cousins and kinsmen, before the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"palace-gate, let him come and let him look! The people flocked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out from all the quarters of the city to witness the execution of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ja'afar and his kinsmen, not knowing the cause. Then they set up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the gallows and made Ja'afar and the others stand underneath in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"readiness for execution, but whilst every eye was looking for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Caliph's signal, and the crowd wept for Ja'afar and his cousins"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the Barmecides, lo and behold! a young man fair of face and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neat of dress and of favour like the moon raining light, with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eyes black and bright, and brow flower-white, and cheeks red as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rose and young down where the beard grows, and a mole like a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grain of ambergris, pushed his way through the people till he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stood immediately before the Wazir and said to him, Safety to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee from this strait, O Prince of the Emirs and Asylum of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"poor! I am the man who slew the woman ye found in the chest, so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hang me for her and do her justice on me! When Ja'afar heard the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,youth's confession he rejoiced at his own deliverance. but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,grieved and sorrowed for the fair youth; and whilst they were yet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"talking behold, another man well stricken in years pressed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forwards through the people and thrust his way amid the populace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till he came to Ja'afar and the youth, whom he saluted saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ho thou the Wazir and Prince sans-peer! believe not the words of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this youth. Of a surety none murdered the damsel but I; take her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wreak on me this moment; for, an thou do not thus, I will require"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it of thee before Almighty Allah. Then quoth the young man, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir, this is an old man in his dotage who wotteth not whatso he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saith ever, and I am he who murdered her, so do thou avenge her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on me! Quoth the old man, O my son, thou art young and desirest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the joys of the world and I am old and weary and surfeited with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the world: I will offer my life as a ransom for thee and for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir and his cousins. No one murdered the damsel but I, so Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon thee, make haste to hang me, for no life is left in me now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that hers is gone. The Wazir marvelled much at all this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"strangeness and, taking the young man and the old man, carried"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them before the Caliph, where, after kissing the ground seven"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"times between his hands, he said, O Commander of the Faithful, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bring thee the murderer of the damsel! Where is he? asked the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Caliph and Ja'afar answered, This young man saith, I am the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"murderer, and this old man giving him the lie saith, I am the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"murderer, and behold, here are the twain standing before thee."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Caliph looked at the old man and the young man and asked,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Which of you killed the girl? The young man replied, No one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slew her save I; and the old man answered, Indeed none killed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her but myself. Then said the Caliph to Ja'afar, Take the twain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and hang them both; but Ja'afar rejoined, Since one of them was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the murderer, to hang the other were mere injustice.[FN#357] By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Him who raised the firmament and dispread the earth like a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carpet, cried the youth, I am he who slew the damsel; and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went on to describe the manner of her murder and the basket, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mantilla and the bit of carpet, in fact all that the Caliph had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,found upon her. So the Caliph was certified that the young man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was the murderer; whereat he wondered and asked him, 'What was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the cause of thy wrongfully doing this damsel to die and what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made thee confess the murder without the bastinado, and what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brought thee here to yield up thy life, and what made thee say Do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her wreak upon me? The youth answered, Know, O Commander of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Faithful, that this woman was my wife and the mother of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,children; also my first cousin and the daughter of my paternal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"uncle, this old man who is my father's own brother. When I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,married her she was a maid [FN#358] and Allah blessed me with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,three male children by her; she loved me and served me and I saw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"no evil in her, for I also loved her with fondest love. Now on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the first day of this month she fell ill with grievous sickness
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I fetched in physicians to her; but recovery came to her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"little by little. and, when I wished her to go to the Hammam-bath,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she said, There is a something I long for before I go to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the bath and I long for it with an exceeding longing. To hear is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to comply, said I. And what is it? Quoth she, I have a queasy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"craving for an apple, to smell it and bite a bit of it. I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, Hadst thou a thousand longings I would try to satisfy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them! So I went on the instant into the city and sought for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"apples but could find none; yet, had they cost a gold piece each,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would I have bought them. I was vexed at this and went home and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, O daughter of my uncle. by Allah I can find none! She was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"distressed, being yet very weakly, and her weakness in. creased"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,greatly on her that night and I felt anxious and alarmed on her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,account. As soon as morning dawned I went out again and made the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"round of the gardens, one by one, but found no apples anywhere."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,At last there met me an old gardener. of whom I asked about them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he answered, O my son, this fruit is a rarity with us and is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not now to be found save in the garden of the Commander of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Faithful at Bassorah, where the gardener keepeth it for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Caliph's eating. I returned to my house troubled by my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ill-success; and my love for my wife and my affection moved me to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,undertake the journey. So I gat me ready and set out and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"travelled fifteen days and nights, going and coming, and brought"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her three apples which I bought from the gardener for three
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dinars. But when I went in to my wife and set them before her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she took no pleasure in them and let them lie by her side; for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her weakness and fever had increased on her and her malady lasted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"without abating ten days, after which time she began to recover"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,health. So I left my house and betaking me to my shop sat there
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"buying and selling; and about midday behold, a great ugly black"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slave, long as a lance and broad as a bench, passed by my shop"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,holding in hand one of the three apples wherewith he was playing.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth I, O my good slave, tell me whence thou tookest that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"apple, that I may get the like of it? He laughed and answered,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I got it from my mistress, for I had been absent and on my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"return I found her lying ill with three apples by her side, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she said to me, 'My horned wittol of a husband made a journey for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them to Bassorah and bought them for three dinars.' So I ate and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drank with her and took this one from her. [FN#359] When I heard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"such words from the slave, O Commander of the Faithful, the world"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grew black before my face, and I arose and locked up my shop and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went home beside myself for excess of rage. I looked for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"apples and finding only two of the three asked my wife, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cousin, where is the third apple?; and raising her head"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"languidly she answered, I wet not, O son of my uncle, where 'tis"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gone! This convinced me that the slave had spoken the truth, so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I took a knife and coming behind her got upon her breast without
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a word said and cut her throat. Then I hewed off her head and her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"limbs in pieces and, wrapping her in her mantilla and a rag of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carpet, hurriedly sewed up the whole which I set in a chest and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"locking it tight, loaded it on my he-mule and threw it into the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tigris with my own hands. So Allah upon thee, O Commander of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Faithful, make haste to hang me, as I fear lest she appeal for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"vengeance on Resurrection Day. For, when I had thrown her into"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the river and none knew aught of it, as I went back home I found"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my eldest son crying and yet he knew naught of what I had done
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with his mother. I asked him, What hath made thee weep, my boy?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he answered, I took one of the three apples which were by my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mammy and went down into the lane to play with my brethren when
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"behold, a big long black slave snatched it from my hand and said."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"'Whence hadst thou this?' Quoth I, 'My father travelled far for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it, and brought it from Bassorah for my mother who was ill and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,two other apples for which he paid three ducats.' He took no heed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of my words and I asked for the apple a second and a third time,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but he cuffed me and kicked me and went off with it. I was afraid
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lest my mother should swinge me on account of the apple, so for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fear of her I went with my brother outside the city and stayed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there till evening closed in upon us; and indeed I am in fear of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her; and now by Allah, O my father, say nothing to her of this or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it may add to her ailment! When I heard what-my child said I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"knew that the slave was he who had foully slandered my wife, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter of my uncle, and was certified that I had slain her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wrong. fully. So I wept with exceeding weeping and presently this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"old man, my paternal uncle and her father, came in; and I told"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him what had happened and he sat down by my side and wept and we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ceased not weeping till midnight. We have kept up mourning for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her these last five days and we lamented her in the deepest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sorrow for that she was unjustly done to die. This came from the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gratuitous lying of the slave, the blackamoor, and this was the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"manner of my killing her; so I conjure thee, by the honour of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thine ancestors, make haste to kill me and do her justice upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, as there is no living for me after her! The Caliph marvelled"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at his words and said, By Allah, the young man is excusable: I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will hang none but the accursed slave and I will do a deed which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shall comfort the ill-at-ease and suffering, and which shall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,please the All-glorious King.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of day and ceased saying her permitted say,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                When it was the Twentieth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"swore he would hang none but the slave, for the youth was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"excusable. Then he turned to Ja'afar and said to him, Bring"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before me this accursed slave who was the sole cause of this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"calamity; and, if thou bring him not before me within three days,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou shalt be slain in his stead. So Ja'afar fared forth weeping
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and saying. Two deaths have already beset me, nor shall the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,crock come of safe from every shock.' [FN#360] In this matter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,craft and cunning are of no avail; but He who preserved my life
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the first time can preserve it a second time. By Allah, I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not leave my house during the three days of life which remain to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me and let the Truth (whose perfection be praised!) do e'en as He
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will. So he kept his house three days, and on the fourth day he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,summoned the Kazis and legal witnesses and made his last will and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"testament, and took leave of his children weeping. Presently in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came a messenger from the Caliph and said to him, The Commander"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the Faithful is in the most violent rage that can be, and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sendeth to seek thee and he sweareth that the day shall certainly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not pass without thy being hanged unless the slave be forth-coming.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When Ja'afar heard this he wept, and his children and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slaves and all who were in the house wept with him. After he had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bidden adieu to everybody except his youngest daughter, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"proceeded to farewell her; for he loved this wee one, who was a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beautiful child, more than all his other children; and he pressed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her to his breast and kissed her and wept bitterly at parting
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from her; when he felt something round inside the bosom of her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dress and asked her, O my little maid, what is in thy bosom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pocket?; O my father, she replied, it is an apple with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,name of our Lord the Caliph written upon it. Rayhán our slave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brought it to me four days ago and would not let me have it till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I gave him two dinars for it. When Ja'afar heard speak of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slave and the apple, he was glad and put his hand into his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,child's pocket [FN#361] and drew out the apple and knew it and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoiced saying, O ready Dispeller of trouble  [FN#362] Then he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bade them bring the slave and said to him, Fie upon thee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Rayhan! whence haddest thou this apple? By Allah, O my master,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he replied, though a lie may get a man once off, yet may truth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"get him off, and well off, again and again. I did not steal this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,apple from thy palace nor from the gardens of the Commander of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Faithful. The fact is that five days ago, as I was walking"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"along one of the alleys of this city, I saw some little ones at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,play and this apple in hand of one of them. So I snatched it from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him and beat him and he cried and said, 'O youth this apple is my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mother's and she is ill. She told my father how she longed for an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"apple, so he travelled to Bassorah and bought her three apples"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for three gold pieces, and I took one of them to play withal.' He"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wept again, but I paid no heed to what he said and carried it off"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and brought it here, and my little lady bought it of me for two"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dinars of gold. And this is the whole story. When Ja'afar heard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his words he marvelled that the murder of the damsel and all this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,misery should have been caused by his slave; he grieved for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"relation of the slave to himself, while rejoicing over his own"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deliverance, and he repeated these lines: --"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If ill betide thee through thy slave, * Make him forthright thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     sacrifice:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"A many serviles thou shalt find, * But life comes once and never"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     twice.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he took the slave's hand and, leading him to the Caliph,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,related the story from first to last and the Caliph marvelled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with extreme astonishment, and laughed till he fell on his back"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and ordered that the story be recorded and be made public amongst
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the people. But Ja'afar said, Marvel not, O Commander of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Faithful, at this adventure, for it is not more wondrous than the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,History of the Wazir Núr al-Dín Ali of Egypt and his brother
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shams al-Dín Mohammed. -- Quoth the Caliph, Out with it; but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what can be stranger than this story? And Ja'afar answered, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Commander of the Faithful, I will not tell it thee, save on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"condition that thou pardon my slave; and the Caliph rejoined,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If it be indeed more wondrous than that of the three apples, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grant thee his blood, and if not I will surely slay thy slave."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So Ja'afar began in these words the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,                TALE OF NUR AL-DIN AND HIS SON.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O Commander of the Faithful, that in times of yore the land"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of Egypt was ruled by a Sultan endowed with justice and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"generosity, one who loved the pious poor and companied with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Olema and learned men; and he had a Wazir, a wise and an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"experienced, well versed in affairs and in the art of government."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"This Minister, who was a very old man, had two sons, as they were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"two moons; never man saw the like of them for beauty and grace,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the elder called Shams al-Din Mohammed and the younger Nur al-Din
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ali; but the younger excelled the elder in seemliness and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pleasing semblance, so that folk heard his fame in far countries"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and men flocked to Egypt for the purpose of seeing him. In
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"course of time their father, the Wazir, died and was deeply"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"regretted and mourned by the Sultan, who sent for his two sons"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, investing them with dresses of honour, [FN#363] said to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them, Let not your hearts be troubled, for ye shall stand in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,your father's stead and be joint Ministers of Egypt. At this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they rejoiced and kissed the ground before him and performed the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ceremonial mourning [FN#364] for their father during a full
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"month; after which time they entered upon the Wazirate, and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,power passed into their hands as it had been in the hands of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their father, each doing duty for a week at a time. They lived"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,under the same roof and their word was one; and whenever the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Sultan desired to travel they took it by turns to be in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,attendance on him. It fortuned one night that the Sultan
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"purposed setting out on a journey next morning, and the elder,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whose turn it was to accompany him, was sitting conversing with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his brother and said to him, O my brother, it is my wish that we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"both marry, I and thou, two sisters; and go in to our wives on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one and the same night. Do, O my brother, as thou desirest,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the younger replied, for right is thy recking and surely I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,comply with thee in whatso thou sayest. So they agreed upon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this and quoth Shams al-Din, If Allah decree that we marry two"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"damsels and go in to them on the same night, and they shall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,conceive on their bridenights and bear children to us on the same
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"day, and by Allah's will they wife bear thee a son and my wife"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bear me a daughter, let us wed them either to other, for they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will be cousins. Quoth Nur al-Din, O my brother, Shams al-Din,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what dower [FN#365] wilt thou require from my son for thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter? Quoth Shams al-Din, I will take three thousand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dinars and three pleasure gardens and three farms; and it would
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not be seemly that the youth make contract for less than this.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When Nur al-Din heard such demand he said, What manner of dower"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is this thou wouldst impose upon my son? Wottest thou not that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,we are brothers and both by Allah's grace Wazirs and equal in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,office? It behoveth thee to offer thy daughter to my son without
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marriage settlement; or if one need be, it should represent a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mere nominal value by way of show to the world: for thou knowest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that the masculine is worthier than the feminine, and my son is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"male and our memory will be preserved by him, not by thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter. But what, said Shams al-Din, is she to have?; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nur al-Din continued, Through her we shall not be remembered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,among the Emirs of the earth; but I see thou wouldest do with me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"according to the saying:--An thou wouldst bluff off a buyer, ask"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him high price and higher; or as did a man who, they say, went to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a friend and asked something of him being in necessity and was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, 'Bismallah, [FN#366] in the name of Allah, I will do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all what thou requirest but come to-morrow!' Whereupon the other
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,replied in this verse:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When he who is asked a favour saith To-morrow, * The wise man"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wots 'tis vain to beg or borrow.'
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth Shams al-Din, Basta! [FN#367] I see thee fail in respect"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to me by making thy son of more account than my daughter; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,'tis plain that thine understanding is of the meanest and that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou lackest manners. Thou remindest me of thy partnership in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Wazirate, when I admitted thee to share with me only in pity"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for thee, and not wishing to mortify thee; and that thou mightest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,help me as a manner of assistant. But since thou talkest on this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wise, by Allah, I will never marry my daughter to thy son; no,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not for her weight in gold! When Nur al-Din heard his brother's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"words he waxed wroth and said, And I too, I will never, never"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marry my son to thy daughter; no, not to keep from my lips the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cup of death. Shams al-Din replied, I would not accept him as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a husband for her, and he is not worth a paring of her nail."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Were I not about to travel I would make an example of thee;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"however when I return thou shalt see, and I will show thee, how I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,can assert my dignity and vindicate my honour. But Allah doeth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whatso He willeth.[FN#368] When Nur al-Din heard this speech
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from his brother, he was filled with fury and lost his wits for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rage; but he hid what he felt and held his peace; and each of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brothers passed the night in a place far apart, wild with wrath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,against the other. As soon as morning dawned the Sultan fared
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth in state and crossed over from Cairo [FN#369] to Jizah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"[FN#370] and made for the pyramids, accompanied by the Wazir"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shams al-Din, whose turn of duty it was, whilst his brother Nur"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-din, who passed the night in sore rage, rose with the light"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and prayed the dawn-prayer. Then he betook himself to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"treasury and, taking a small pair of saddle-bags, filled them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with gold; and he called to mind his brother's threats and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"contempt wherewith he had treated him, and he repeated these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Travel! and thou shalt find new friends for old ones left
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     behind; * Toil! for the sweets of human life by toil and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     moil are found:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The stay-at-home no honour wins nor aught attains but want; * So
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     leave thy place of birth [FN#371] and wander all the world
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     around!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I've seen, and very oft I've seen, how standing water stinks, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     And only flowing sweetens it and trotting makes it sound:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And were the moon forever full and ne'er to wax or wane, * Man"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     would not strain his watchful eyes to see its gladsome
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     round:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Except the lion leave his lair he ne'er would fell his game, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Except the arrow leave the bow ne'er had it reached its
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bound:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Gold-dust is dust the while it lies untravelled in the mine, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     And aloes-wood mere fuel is upon its native ground:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And gold shall win his highest worth when from his goal ungoal'd;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     * And aloes sent to foreign parts grows costlier than gold.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When he ended his verse he bade one of his pages saddle him his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Nubian mare-mule with her padded selle. Now she was a dapple-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grey, [FN#372] with ears like reed-pens and legs like columns and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a back high and strong as a dome builded on pillars; her saddle
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was of gold-cloth and her stirrups of Indian steel, and her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,housing of Ispahan velvet; she had trappings which would serve
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Chosroes, and she was like a bride adorned for her wedding"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,night. Moreover he bade lay on her back a piece of silk for a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seat, and a prayer-carpet under which were his saddle-bags. When"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this was done he said to his pages and slaves, I purpose going"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forth a-pleasuring outside the city on the road to Kalyub-town,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#373] and I shall lie three nights abroad; so let none of you
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"follow me, for there is something straiteneth my breast. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he mounted the mule in haste; and, taking with him some provaunt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for the way, set out from Cairo and faced the open and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,uncultivated country lying around it. [FN#374] About noontide he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered Bilbays-city, [FN#375] where he dismounted and stayed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,awhile to rest himself and his mule and ate some of his victual.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,He bought at Bilbays all he wanted for himself and forage for his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mule and then fared on the way of the waste. Towards night-fall
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he entered a town called Sa'adiyah [FN#376] where he alighted and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took out somewhat of his viaticum and ate; then he spread his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,strip of silk on the sand and set the saddle-bags under his head
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and slept in the open air; for he was still overcome with anger.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When morning dawned he mounted and rode onward till he reached
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Holy City, [FN#377] Jerusalem, and thence he made Aleppo,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where he dismounted at one of the caravanserais and abode three
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,days to rest himself and the mule and to smell the air. [FN#378]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then, being determined to travel afar and Allah having written"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"safety in his fate, he set out again, wending without wotting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whither he was going; and, having fallen in with certain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"couriers, he stinted not travelling till he had reached Bassorah-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,city albeit he knew not what the place was. It was dark night
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when he alighted at the Khan, so he spread out his prayer-carpet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and took down the saddle-bags from the back of his mule and gave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her with her furniture in charge of the door-keeper that he might
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,walk her about. The man took her and did as he was bid. Now it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so happened that the Wazir of Bassorah, a man shot in years, was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sitting at the lattice-window of his palace opposite the Khan and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he saw the porter walking the mule up and down. He was struck by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her trappings of price and thought her a nice beast fit for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,riding of Wazirs or even of royalties; and the more he looked the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"more was he perplexed till at last he said to one of his pages,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bring hither yon door-keeper, The page went and returned to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Wazir with the porter who kissed the ground between his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hands, and the Minister asked him, Who is the owner of yonder"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mule and what manner of man is he?; and he answered, O my lord,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the owner of this mule is a comely young man of pleasant manners,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"withal grave and dignified, and doubtless one of the sons of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,merchants. When the Wazir heard the door-keeper's words he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arose forthright; and, mounting his horse, rode to the Khan"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"[FN#379] and went in to Nur al-Din who, seeing the minister"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"making towards him, rose to his feet and advanced to meet him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saluted him. The Wazir welcomed him to Bassorah and dis-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mounting, embraced him and made him sit down by his side and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, O my son, whence comest thou and what dost thou seek? O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my lord, Nur al-Din replied, I have come from Cairo-city of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which my father was whilome Wazir; but he hath been removed to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the grace of Allah; and he informed him of all that had befallen
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him from beginning to end, adding, I am resolved never to return"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,home before I have seen all the cities and countries of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"world. When the Wazir heard this, he said to him, O my son,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hearken not to the voice of passion lest it cast thee into the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pit; for indeed many regions be waste places and I fear for thee
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the turns of Time. Then he let load the saddle-bags and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,silk and prayer-carpets on the mule and carried Nur al-Din to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"own house, where he lodged him in a pleasant place and entreated"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him honourably and made much of him, for he inclined to love him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with exceeding love. After a while he said to him, O my son,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"here am I left a man in years and have no male children, but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah hath blessed me with a daughter who eventh thee in beauty;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I have rejected all her many suitors, men of rank and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,substance. But affection for thee hath entered into my heart;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"say me, then, wilt thou be to her a husband? If thou accept"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this, I will go up with thee to the Sultan of Bassorah [FN#380]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and will tell him that thou art my nephew, the son of my brother,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and bring thee to be appointed Wazir in my place that I may keep
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the house for, by Allah, O my son, I am stricken in years and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"aweary. When Nur al-Din heard the Wazir's words, he bowed his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"head in modesty and said, To hear is to obey! At this the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wazir rejoiced and bade his servants prepare a feast and decorate
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the great assembly-hall, wherein they were wont to celebrate the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,marriages of Emirs and Grandees. Then he assembled his friends
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the notables of the reign and the merchants of Bassorah and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when all stood before him he said to them, I had a brother who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was Wazir in the land of Egypt, and Allah Almighty blessed him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with two sons, whilst to me, as well ye wot, He hath given a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,daughter. My brother charged me to marry my daughter to one of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his sons, whereto I assented; and, when my daughter was of age to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marry, he sent me one of his sons, the young man now present, to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whom I purpose marrying her, drawing up the contract and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,celebrating the night of unveiling with due ceremony; for he is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nearer and dearer to me than a stranger and, after the wedding,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"if he please he shall abide with me, or if he desire to travel I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will forward him and his wife to his father's home. Hereat one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and all replied, Right is thy recking; and they all looked at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the bridegroom and were pleased with him. So the Wazir sent for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Kazi and legal witnesses and they wrote out the marriage-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"contract, after which the slaves perfumed the guests with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"incense, [FN#381] and served them with sherbet of sugar and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sprinkled rose-water on them and all went their ways. Then the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wazir bade his servants take Nur al-Din to the Hammam-baths and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sent him a suit of the best of his own especial raiment, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,napkins and towelry and bowls and perfume-burners and all else
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that was required. After the bath, when he came out and donned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the dress, he was even as the full moon on the fourteenth night;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he mounted his mule and stayed not till he reached the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wazir's palace. There he dismounted and went in to the Minister
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and kissed his hands, and the Wazir bade him welcome.--And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Twenty-first Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stood up to him and welcoming him said, Arise and go in to thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wife this night, and on the morrow I will carry thee to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sultan, and pray Allah bless thee with all manner of weal. So"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Nur al-Din left him and went into his wife the Wazir's daughter.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thus far concerning him, but as regards his eldest brother, Shams"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-Din, he was absent with the Sultan a long time and when he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,returned from his journey he found not his brother; and he asked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of his servants and slaves who answered, On the day of thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"departure with the Sultan, thy brother mounted his mule fully"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"caparisoned as for state procession saying, 'I am going towards"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Kalyub-town and I shall be absent one day or at most two days;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for my breast is straitened, and let none of you follow me.'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he fared forth and from that time to this we have heard no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tidings of him. Shams al-Din was greatly troubled at the sudden
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disappearance of his brother and grieved with exceeding grief at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the loss and said to himself, This is only because I chided and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upbraided him the night before my departure with the Sultan;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,haply his feelings were hurt and he fared forth a-travelling; but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I must send after him. Then he went in to the Sultan and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,acquainted him with what had happened and wrote letters and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dispatches, which he sent by running footmen to his deputies in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,every province. But during the twenty days of his brother's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,absence Nur al-Din had travelled far and had reached Bassorah; so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after diligent search the messengers failed to come at any news
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of him and returned. Thereupon Shams al-Din despaired of finding
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his brother and said, Indeed I went beyond all bounds in what I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,said to him with reference to the marriage of our children.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Would that I had not done so! This all cometh of my lack of wit
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and want of caution. Soon after this he sought in marriage the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter of a Cairene merchant, [FN#382] and drew up the marriage"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"contract and went in to her. And it so chanced that, on the very"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"same night when Shams al-Din went in to his wife, Nur al-Din also"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went in to his wife the daughter of the Wazir of Bassorah; this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"being in accordance with the will of Almighty Allah, that He"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"might deal the decrees of Destiny to His creatures. Furthermore,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it was as the two brothers had said; for their two wives became
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pregnant by them on the same night and both were brought to bed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on the same day; the wife of Shams al-Din, Wazir of Egypt, of a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter, never in Cairo was seen a fairer; and the wife of Nur"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-Din of a son, none more beautiful was ever seen in his time,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,as one of the poets said concerning the like of him:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"That jetty hair, that glossy brow,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     My slender-waisted youth, of thine,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Can darkness round creation throw,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Or make it brightly shine.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The dusky mole that faintly shows
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Upon his cheek, ah! blame it not:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The tulip-flower never blows
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Undarkened by its spot [FN#383]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And as another also said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,His scent was musk and his cheek was rose; * His teeth are pearls
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and his lips drop wine;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,His form is a brand and his hips a hill; * His hair is night and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     his face moon-shine.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"They named the boy Badr al-Din Hasan and his grandfather, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir of Bassorah, rejoiced in him and, on the seventh day after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his birth, made entertainments and spread banquets which would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,befit the birth of Kings' sons and heirs. Then he took Nur al-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Din and went up with him to the Sultan, and his son-in-law, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he came before the presence of the King, kissed the ground"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"between his hands and repeated these verses, for he was ready of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"speech, firm of sprite and good in heart as he was goodly in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,form:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The world's best joys long be thy lot, my lord! * And last while"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     darkness and the dawn o'erlap:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O thou who makest, when we greet thy gifts, * The world to dance"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and Time his palms to clap. [FN#384]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then the Sultan rose up to honour them, and thanking Nur al-Din"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for his fine compliment, asked the Wazir, Who may be this young"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man?; and the Minister answered, This is my brother's son, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"related his tale from first to last. Quoth the Sultan, And how"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,comes he to be thy nephew and we have never heard speak of him?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth the Minister, O our lord the Sultan, I had a brother who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was Wazir in the land of Egypt and he died, leaving two sons,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereof the elder hath taken his father's place and the younger,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whom thou seest, came to me. I had sworn I would not marry my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,daughter to any but to him; so when he came I married him to her.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#385] Now he is young and I am old; my hearing is dulled and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my judgement is easily fooled; wherefore I would solicit our lord
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Sultan [FN#386] to set him in my stead, for he is my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brother's son and my daughter's husband; and he is fit for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazirate, being a man of good counsel and ready contrivance."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Sultan looked at Nur al-Din and liked him, so he stablished"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him in office as the Wazir had requested and formally appointed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, presenting him with a splendid dress of honour and a she-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mule from his private stud; and assigning to him solde, stipends"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and supplies. Nur al-Din kissed the Sultan's hand and went home,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he and his father-in-law, joying with exceeding joy and saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,All this followeth on the heels of the boy Hasan's birth! Next
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"day he presented himself before the King and, kissing the ground,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,began repeating:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Grow thy weal and thy welfare day by day: * And thy luck
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     prevail o'er the envier's spite;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And ne'er cease thy days to be white as day, * And thy foeman's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     day to be black as night!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Sultan bade him be seated on the Wazir's seat, so he sat down"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and applied himself to the business of his office and went into
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the cases of the lieges and their suits, as is the wont of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ministers; while the Sultan watched him and wondered at his wit
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and good sense, judgement and insight. Wherefor he loved him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took him into intimacy. When the Divan was dismissed Nur al-Din
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,returned to his house and related what had passed to his father-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in-law who rejoiced. And thenceforward Nur al-Din ceased not so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to administer the Wazirate that the Sultan would not be parted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from him night or day; and increased his stipend and supplies
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,until his means were ample and he became the owner of ships that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made trading voyages at his command, as well as of Mamelukes and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blackamoor slaves; and he laid out many estates and set up
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Persian wheels and planted gardens. When his son Hasan was four
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"years of age, the old Wazir deceased and he made for his father-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in-law a sumptuous funeral ceremony ere he was laid in the dust.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he occupied himself with the education of this son and, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the boy waxed strong and came to the age of seven, he brought him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a Fakih, a doctor of law and religion, to teach him in his own"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,house and charged him to give him a good education and instruct
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him in politeness and manners. So the tutor made the boy read
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and retain all varieties of useful knowledge, after he had spent"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,some years in learning the Koran by heart; [FN#387] and he ceased
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not to grow in beauty and stature and symmetry, even as saith the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,poet:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,In his face-sky shines the fullest moon; * In his cheeks' anemone
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     glows the sun:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,He so conquered Beauty that he hath won * All charms of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     humanity one by one.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The professor brought him up in his father's palace teaching him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reading, writing and cyphering, theology and belles lettres. His"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,grandfather the old Wazir had bequeathed to him the whole of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,property when he was but four years of age. Now during all the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"time of his earliest youth he had never left the house, till on a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"certain day his father, the Wazir Nur al-Din, clad him in his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"best clothes and, mounting him on a she-mule of the finest, went"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up with him to the Sultan. The King gazed at Badr al-Din Hasan
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and marvelled at his comeliness and loved him. As for the city-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"folk, when he first passed before them with his father, they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,marvelled at his exceeding beauty and sat down on the road
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"expecting his return, that they might look their fill on his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace; even as the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,poet said in these verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"As the sage watched the stars, the semblance clear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Of a fair youth on 's scroll he saw appear.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Those jetty locks Canopus o'er him threw,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And tinged his temple curls a musky hue;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Mars dyed his ruddy cheek; and from his eyes
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Archer-star his glittering arrow flies;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"His wit from Hermes came; and Soha's care,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,(The half-seen star that dimly haunts the Bear)
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Kept off all evil eyes that threaten and ensnare,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The sage stood mazed to see such fortunes meet,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And Luna kissed the earth beneath his feet. [FN#388]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And they blessed him aloud as he passed and called upon Almighty
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah to bless him. [FN#389] The Sultan entreated the lad with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"especial favour and said to his father, O Wazir, thou must needs"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bring him daily to my presence; whereupon he replied, I hear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I obey. Then the Wazir returned home with his son and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ceased not to carry him to court till he reached the age of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"twenty. At that time the Minister sickened and, sending for Badr"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-Din Hasan, said to him, Know, O my son, that the world of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Present is but a house of mortality, while that of the Future is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a house of eternity. I wish, before I die, to bequeath thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,certain charges and do thou take heed of what I say and incline
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy heart to my words. Then he gave him last instructions as to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the properest way of dealing with his neighbours and the due
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,management of his affairs; after which he called to mind his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brother and his home and his native land and wept over his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,separation from those he had first loved. Then he wiped away his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tears and, turning to his son, said to him, Before I proceed, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my son, to my last charges and injunctions, know that I have a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother, and thou hast an uncle, Shams al-Din hight, the Wazir of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Cairo, which whom I parted, leaving him against his will. Now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,take thee a sheet of paper and write upon it whatso I say to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee. Badr al-Din took a fair leaf and set about doing his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,father's bidding and he wrote thereon a full account of what had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,happened to his sire first and last; the dates of his arrival at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Bassorah and of his foregathering with the Wazir; of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marriage, of his going in to the Minister's daughter and of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"birth of his son; brief, his life of forty years from the date of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his dispute with his brother, adding the words, And this is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,written at my dictation and may Almighty Allah be with him when I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"am gone! Then he folded the paper and sealed it and said, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan, O my son, keep this paper with all care; for it will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"enable thee to stablish thine origin and rank and lineage and, if"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"anything contrary befal thee, set out for Cairo and ask for thine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,uncle and show him this paper and say to him that I died a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stranger far from mine own people and full of yearning to see him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and them. So Badr al-Din Hasan took the document and folded it;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, wrapping it up in a piece of waxed cloth of his skull-cap"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and wound his light turband [FN#390] round it. And he fell to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"weeping over his father and at parting with him, and he but a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"boy. Then Nur al-Din lapsed into a swoon, the forerunner of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"death; but presently recovering himself he said, O Hasan, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son, I will now bequeath to thee five last behests. The FIRST"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"BEHEST is, Be over-intimate with none, nor frequent any, nor be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,familiar with any; so shalt thou be safe from his mischief;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#391] for security lieth in seclusion of thought and a certain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,retirement from the society of thy fellows; and I have heard it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,said by a poet:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,In this world there is none thou mayst count upon * To befriend
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thy case in the nick of need:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So live for thyself nursing hope of none * Such counsel I give
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     thee: enow, take heed!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The SECOND BEHEST is, O my son: Deal harshly with none lest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fortune with thee deal hardly; for the fortune of this world is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one day with thee and another day against thee and all worldly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,goods are but a loan to be repaid. And I have heard a poet say:-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Take thought nor hast to win the thing thou wilt; * Have ruth on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     man for ruth thou may'st require:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,No hand is there but Allah's hand is higher; * No tyrant but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     shall rue worse tyrant's ire!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The THIRD BEHEST is, Learn to be silent in society and let thine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,own faults distract thine attention from the faults of other men:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for it is said:--In silence dwelleth safety, and thereon I have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heard the lines that tell us:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Reserve's a jewel, Silence safety is; * Whenas thou speakest many"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     a word withhold;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"For an of Silence thou repent thee once, * Of speech thou shalt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     repent times manifold.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The FOURTH BEHEST, O my son, is Beware of wine-bibbing, for wine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is the head of all frowardness and a fine solvent of human wits.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So shun, and again I say, shun mixing strong liquor; for I have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heard a poet say [FN#392]:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,From wine [FN#393] I turn and whoso wine-cups swill; *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Becoming one of those who deem it ill:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wine driveth man to miss salvation-way, [FN#394] * And opes the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     gateway wide to sins that kill.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The FIFTH BEHEST, O my son, is Keep thy wealth and it will keep"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee; guard thy money and it will guard thee; and waste not thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,substance lest haply thou come to want and must fare a-begging
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from the meanest of mankind. Save thy dirhams and deem them the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sovereignest salve for the wounds of the world. And here again I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have heard that one of the poets said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When fails my wealth no friend will deign befriend: * When
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     wealth abounds all friends their friendship tender:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,How many friends lent aid my wealth to spend; * But friends to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     lack of wealth no friendship render.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,On this wise Nur al-Din ceased not to counsel his son Badr al-Din
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan till his hour came and, sighing one sobbing sigh, his life"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went forth. Then the voice of mourning and keening rose high in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his house and the Sultan and all the grandees grieved for him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,buried him; but his son ceased not lamenting his loss for two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"months, during which he never mounted horse, nor attended the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Divan nor presented himself before the Sultan. At last the King,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"being wroth with him, stablished in his stead one of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Chamberlains and made him Wazir, giving orders to seize and set"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seals on all Nur al-Din's houses and goods and domains. So the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,new Wazir went forth with a mighty posse of Chamberlains and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"people of the Divan, and watchmen and a host of idlers to do this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and to seize Badr al-Din Hasan and carry him before the King, who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would deal with him as he deemed fit. Now there was among the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crowd of followers a Mameluke of the deceased Wazir who, when he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard this order, urged his horse and rode at full speed to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,house of Badr al-Din Hasan; for he cold not endure to see the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ruin of his old master's son. He found him sitting at the gate
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with head hung down and sorrowing, as was his wont, for the loss"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of his father; so he dismounted and kissing his hand said to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my lord and son of my lord, haste ere ruin come and lay"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waste! When Hasan heard this he trembled and asked, What may"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be the matter?; and the man answered, The Sultan is angered with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee and hath issued a warrant against thee, and evil cometh hard"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon my track; so flee with thy life! At these words Hasan's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heart flamed with the fire of bale, and his rose-red cheek turned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pale, and he said to the Mameluke, O my brother, is there time"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for me to go in and get me some worldly gear which may stand me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in stead during my strangerhood? But the slave replied, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lord, up at once and save thyself and leave this house, while it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is yet time. And he quoted these lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Escape with thy life, if oppression betide thee, * And let the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     house of its builder's fate!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Country for country thou'lt find, if thou seek it; * Life for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     life never, early or late."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"It is strange men should dwell in the house of abjection, * When"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     the plain of God's earth is so wide and so great! [FN#395]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"At these words of the Mameluke, Badr al-Din covered his head with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the skirt of his garment and went forth on foot till he stood
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"outside of the city, where he heard folk saying, The Sultan hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sent his new Wazir to the house of the old Wazir, now no more, to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seal his property and seize his son Badr al-Din Hasan and take
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him before the presence, that he may put him to death;  and all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried, Alas for his beauty and his loveliness! When he heard"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this he fled forth at hazard, knowing not whither he was going,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and gave not over hurrying onwards till Destiny drove him to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"father's tomb. So he entered the cemetery and, threading his way"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"through the graves, at last he reached the sepulchre where he sat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down and let fall from his head the skirt of his long robe
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#396] which was made of brocade with a gold-embroidered hem
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whereon were worked these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O thou whose forehead, like the radiant East, * Tells of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     stars of Heaven and bounteous dews:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Endure thine honour to the latest day, * And Time thy growth of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     glory ne'er refuse!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"While he was sitting by his father's tomb behold, there came to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him a Jew as he were a Shroff, [FN#397] a money-changer, with a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pair of saddle-bags containing much gold, who accosted him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kissed his hand, saying, Whither bound, O my lord; 'tis late in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the day and thou art clad but lightly, and I read signs of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"trouble in thy face? I was sleeping within this very hour,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered Hasan, when my father appeared to me and chid me for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not having visited his tomb; so I awoke trembling and came hither
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forthright lest the day should go by without my visiting him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which would have been grievous to me. O my lord, rejoined the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Jew, [FN#398] thy father had many merchantmen at sea and, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"some of them are now due, it is my wish to buy of thee the cargo"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the first ship that cometh into port with this thousand dinars
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of gold. I consent, quoth Hasan, whereupon the Jew took out a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bag of gold and counted out a thousand sequins which he gave to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan, the son of the Wazir, saying, Write me a letter of sale"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and seal it. So Hasan took a pen and paper and wrote these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"words in duplicate, The writer, Hasan Badr al-Din, son of Wazir"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nur al-Din, hath to Isaac the Jew all the cargo of the first of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his father's ships which cometh into port, for a thousand dinars,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he hath received the price in advance. And after he had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,taken one copy the Jew put it into his pouch and went away; but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hasan fell a-weeping as he thought of the dignity and prosperity
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which had erst been his and he began reciting:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"This house, my lady, since you left is now a home no more * For"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     me, not neighbours, since you left, prove kind and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     neighbourly:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The friend, whilere I took to heart, alas! no more to me * Is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     friend; and even Luna's self displayeth lunacy:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"You left and by your going left the world a waste, a wolf, * And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     lies a gloomy murk upon the face of hill and lea:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,O may the raven-bird whose cry our hapless parting croaked *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Find ne'er a nesty home and eke shed all his plumery!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,At length my patience fails me; and this absence wastes my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,    flesh; * How many a veil by severance rent our eyes are
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,    doomed see:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ah! shall I ever sight again our fair past nights of your; * And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     shall a single house become a home for me once more?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he wept with exceeding weeping and night came upon him; so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he leant his head against his father's grave and sleep overcame
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him: Glory to him who sleepeth not! He ceased not slumbering
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till the moon rose, when his head slipped from off the tomb and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he lay on his back, with limbs outstretched, his face shining"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bright in the moonlight. Now the cemetery was haunted day and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night by Jinns who were of the True Believers, and presently came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out a Jinniyah who, seeing Hasan asleep, marvelled at his beauty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and loveliness and cried, Glory to God! This youth can be none"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,other than one of the Wuldan of Paradise.[FN#399] Then she flew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"firmament-wards to circle it, as was her custom, and met an Ifrit"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on the wing who saluted her and she said to him, Whence comest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou? From Cairo, he replied. Wilt thou come with me and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,look upon the beauty of a youth who sleepeth in yonder burial
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"place? she asked and he answered, I will. So they flew till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they lighted at the tomb and she showed him the youth and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Now diddest thou ever in thy born days see aught like this?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Ifrit looked upon him and exclaimed, Praise be to Him that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hath no equal! But, O my sister, shall I tell thee what I have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seen this day? Asked she, What is that? and he answered, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have seen the counterpart of this youth in the land of Egypt.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,She is the daughter of the Wazir Shams al-Din and she is a model
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of beauty and loveliness, of fairest favour and formous form, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dight with symmetry and perfect grace. When she had reached the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"age of nineteen, [FN#400] the Sultan of Egypt heard of her and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sending for the Wazir her father, said to him, 'Hear me, O Wazir:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it hath reached mine ear that thou hast a daughter and I wish to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"demand her of thee in marriage. The Wazir replied, O our lord"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Sultan, deign accept my excuses and take compassion on my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sorrows, for thou knowest that my brother, who was partner with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me in the Wazirate, disappeared from amongst us many years ago"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and we wot not where he is. Now the cause of his departure was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that one night, as we were sitting together and talking of wives"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and children to come, we had words on the matter and he went off"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in high dudgeon. But I swore that I would marry my daughter to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,none save to the son of my brother on the day her mother gave her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"birth, which was nigh upon nineteen years ago. I have lately"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard that my brother died at Bassorah, where he married the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,daughter of the Wazir and that she bare him a son; and I will not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,marry my daughter but to him in honour of my brother's memory. I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,recorded the date of my marriage and the conception of my wife
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the birth of my daughter; and from her horoscope I find that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her name is conjoined with that of her cousin; [FN#401] and there
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"are damsels in foison for our lord the Sultan.' The King,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hearing his Minister's answer and refusal, waxed wroth with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding wrath and cried, 'When the like of me asketh a girl in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marriage of the like of thee, he conferreth an honour, and thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejectest me and puttest me off with cold [FN#402] excuses! Now,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,by the life of my head I will marry her to the meanest of my men
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in spite of the nose of thee! [FN#403] There was in the palace a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,horse-groom which was a Gobbo with a bunch to his breast and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hunch to his back; and the Sultan sent for him and married him to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the daughter of the Wazir, lief or loath, and hath ordered a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pompous marriage procession for him and that he go in to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bride this very night. I have now just flown hither from Cairo,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where I left the Hunchback at the door of the Hammam-bath amidst
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Sultan's white slaves who were waving lighted flambeaux about
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him. As for the Minister's daughter she sitteth among her nurses
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and tirewomen, weeping and wailing; for they have forbidden her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"father to come near her. Never have I seen, O my sister, more"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hideous being than this Hunchback [FN#404] whilest the young lady
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is the likest of all folk to this young man, albeit even fairer"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than he,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Twenty-second Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Jinni narrated to the Jinniyah how the King had caused the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wedding contract to be drawn up between the hunchbacked groom and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the lovely young lady who was heart-broken for sorrow; and how
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she was the fairest of created things and even more beautiful
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than this youth, the Jinniyah cried at him Thou liest! this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,youth is handsomer than any one of his day. The Ifrit gave her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the lie again, adding, By Allah, O my sister, the damsel I speak"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of is fairer than this; yet none but he deserveth her, for they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,resemble each other like brother and sister or at least cousins.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And, well-away! how she is wasted upon that Hunchback! Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said she, O my brother, let us get under him and lift him up and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carry him to Cairo, that we may compare him with the damsel of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whom thou speakest and so determine whether of the twain is the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fairer. To hear is to obey! replied he, thou speakest to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"point; nor is there a righter recking than this of thine, and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,myself will carry him. So he raised him from the ground and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"flew with him like a bird soaring in upper air, the Ifritah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"keeping close by his side at equal speed, till he alighted with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him in the city of Cairo and set him down on a stone bench and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,woke him up. He roused himself and finding that he was no longer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at his father's tomb in Bassorah-city he looked right and left
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and saw that he was in a strange place; and he would have cried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out; but the Ifrit gave him a cuff which persuaded him to keep
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,silence. Then he brought him rich raiment and clothed him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"therein and, giving him a lighted flambeau, said, Know that I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have brought thee hither, meaning to do thee a good turn for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,love of Allah: so take this torch and mingle with the people at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Hammam-door and walk on with them without stopping till thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,reach the house of the wedding-festival; then go boldly forward
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and enter the great saloon; and fear none, but take thy stand at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the right hand of the Hunchback bridegroom; and, as often as any"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the nurses and tirewomen and singing-girls come up to thee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#405] put thy hand into thy pocket which thou wilt find filled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with gold. Take it out and throw it to them and spare not; for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,as often as thou thrustest fingers in pouch thou shalt find it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"full of coin. Give largesse by handsful and fear nothing, but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"set thy trust upon Him who created thee, for this is not by thine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"own strength but by that of Allah Almighty, that His decrees may"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,take effect upon his creatures. When Badr al-Din Hasan heard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"these words from the Ifrit he said to himself, Would Heaven I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,knew what all this means and what is the cause of such kindness!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"However, he mingled with the people and, lighting his flambeau,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,moved on with the bridal procession till he came to the bath
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where he found the Hunchback already on horseback. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pushed his way in among the crowd, a veritable beauty of a man in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the finest apparel, wearing tarbush [FN#406] and turband and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"long-sleeved robe purfled with gold; and, as often as the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"singing-women stopped for the people to give them largesse, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thrust his hand into his pocket and, finding it full of gold,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took out a handful and threw it on the tambourine [FN#407] till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he had filled it with gold pieces for the music-girls and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tirewomen. The singers were amazed by his bounty and the people
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,marvelled at his beauty and loveliness and the splendour of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dress. He ceased not to do thus till he reached the mansion of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Wazir (who was his uncle), where the Chamberlains drove back"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the people and forbade them to go forward; but the singing-girls
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the tirewomen said, By Allah we will not enter unless this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young man enter with us, for he hath given us length o' life with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his largesse and we will not display the bride unless he be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,present. Therewith they carried him into the bridal hall and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made him sit down defying the evil glances of the hunchbacked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bridegroom. The wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and Courtiers all stood in double line, each holding a massy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cierge ready lighted; all wore thin face-veils and the two rows
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,right and left extended from the bride's throne [FN#408] to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,head of the hall adjoining the chamber whence she was to come
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth. When the ladies saw Badr al-Din Hasan and noted his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beauty and loveliness and his face that shone like the new moon,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their hearts inclined to him and the singing-girls said to all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that were present, Know that this beauty crossed our hands with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,naught but red gold; so be not chary to do him womanly service
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and comply with all he says, no matter what he ask. [FN#409] So"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all the women crowded around Hasan with their torches and gazed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon his loveliness and envied him his beauty; and one and all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would gladly have lain on his bosom an hour or rather a year.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Their hearts were so troubled that they let fall their veils from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before their faces and said, Happy she who belongeth to this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,youth or to whom he belongeth!; and they called down curses on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the crooked groom and on him who was the cause of his marriage to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the girl-beauty; and as often as they blessed Badr al-Din Hasan
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they damned the Hunchback, saying, Verily this youth and none"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"else deserveth our Bride: Ah, well-away for such a lovely one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with this hideous Quasimodo; Allah's curse light on his head and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on the Sultan who commanded the marriage! Then the singing-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"girls beat their tabrets and lulliloo'd with joy, announcing the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,appearing of the bride; and the Wazir's daughter came in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,surrounded by her tirewomen who had made her goodly to look upon;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for they had perfumed her and incensed her and adorned her hair;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and they had robed her in raiment and ornaments befitting the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mighty Chosroes Kings. The most notable part of her dress was a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loose robe worn over her other garments; it was diapered in red
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gold with figures of wild beasts, and birds whose eyes and beaks"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"were of gems, and claws of red rubies and green beryl; and her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neck was graced with a necklace of Yamani work, worth thousands"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of gold pieces, whose bezels were great round jewels of sorts,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the like of which was never owned by Kaysar or by Tobba King.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#410] And the bride was as the full moon when at fullest on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fourteenth night; and as she paced into the hall she was like one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the Houris of Heaven--praise be to Him who created her in such
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,splendour of beauty! The ladies encompassed her as the white
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"contains the black of the eye, they clustering like stars whilst"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she shone amongst them like the moon when it eats up the clouds.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Now Badr al-Din Hasan of Bassorah was sitting in full gaze of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"folk, when the bride came forward with her graceful swaying and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"swimming gait, and her hunchbacked groom stood up to meet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"[FN#411] and receive her: she, however, turned away from the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wight and walked forward till she stood before her cousin Hasan,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the son of her uncle. Whereat the people laughed. But when the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wedding-guests saw her thus attracted towards Badr al-Din they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made a mighty clamour and the singing-women shouted their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loudest; whereupon he put his hand into his pocket and, pulling"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out a handful of gold, cast it into their tambourines and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"girls rejoiced and said, Could we win our wish this bride were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thine! At this he smiled and the folk came round him, flambeaux"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in hand like the eyeball round the pupil, while the Gobbo"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bridegroom was left sitting alone much like a tail-less baboon;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for every time they lighted a candle for him it went out willy-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nilly, so he was left in darkness and silence and looking at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,naught but himself. [FN#412] When Badr al-Din Hasan saw the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bridegroom sitting lonesome in the dark, and all the wedding-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,guests with their flambeaux and wax candles crowding around
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself, he was bewildered and marvelled much; but when he looked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at his cousin, the daughter of his uncle, he rejoiced and felt an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,inward delight: he longed to greet her and gazed intently on her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,face which was radiant with light and brilliancy. Then the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tirewomen took off her veil and displayed her in the first bridal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dress which was of scarlet satin; and Hasan had a view of her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which dazzled his sight and dazed his wits, as she moved to and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fro, swaying with graceful gait; [FN#413] and she turned the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heads of all the guests, women as well as men, for she was even"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,as saith the surpassing poet:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,A sun on wand in knoll of sand she showed * Clad in her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     cramoisy-hued chemisette:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Of her lips honey-dew she gave me drink, * And with her rosy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     cheeks quencht fire she set.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then they changed that dress and displayed her in a robe of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,azure; and she reappeared like the full moon when it riseth over
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the horizon, with her coal-black hair and cheeks delicately fair;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and teeth shown in sweet smiling and breasts firm rising and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,crowning sides of the softest and waist of the roundest. And in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this second suit she was as a certain master of high conceits
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saith of the like of her:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She came apparrelled in an azure vest, * Ultramarine, as skies"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     are deckt and dight;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I view'd th' unparrellel'd sight, which show'd my eyes * A moon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     of Summer on a Winter-night.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then they changed that suit for another and, veiling her face in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the luxuriance of her hair, loosed her lovelocks, so dark, so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"long that their darkness and length outvied the darkest nights,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and she shot through all hearts with the magical shaft of her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eye-babes. They displayed her in the third dress and she was as
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,said of her the sayer:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Veiling her cheeks with hair a-morn she comes, * And I her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     mischiefs with the cloud compare:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Saying, Thou veilest morn with night! Ah, no! * Quoth she,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     I shroud full moon with darkling air!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then they displayed her in the fourth bridal dress and she came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forward shining like the rising sun and swaying to and fro with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lovesome grace and supple ease like a gazelle-fawn. And she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clave all hearts with the arrows of her eyelashes, even as saith"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one who described a charmer like her:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The sun of beauty she to sight appears * And, lovely-coy, she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     mocks all loveliness;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And when he fronts her favour and her smile * A-morn, the Sun of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     day in clouds must dress.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then she came forth in the fifth dress, a very light of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loveliness like a wand of waving willow or a gazelle of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thirsty wold. Those locks which stung like scorpions along her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cheeks were bent, and her neck was bowed in blandishment, and her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hips quivered as she went. As saith one of the poets describing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her in verse:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She comes like fullest moon on happy night; * Taper of waist,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     with shape of magic might:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She hath an eye whose glances quell mankind, * And Ruby on her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     cheeks reflects his light:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Enveils her hips the blackness of her hair; *Beware of curls that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bite with viper-bite!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Her sides are silken-soft, the while the heart * Mere rock behind"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     that surface lurks from sight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,From the fringed curtains of her eyne she shoots * Shafts which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     at farthest range on mark alight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When round her neck or waist I throw my arms * Her breasts repel
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     me with their hardened height.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ah, how her beauty all excels! ah how * That shape transcends the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     graceful waving bough!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then they adorned her with the sixth toilette, a dress which was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,green. And now she shamed her slender straightness the nut-brown
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,spear; her radiant face dimmed the brightest beams of full moon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and she outdid the bending branches in gentle movement and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,flexible grace. Her loveliness exalted the beauties of earth's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,four quarters and she broke men's hearts by the significance of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her semblance; for she was even as saith one of the poets in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,A damsel 'twas the tirer's art had decked with snares and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     sleight.[FN#414] * And robed in rays as though the sun from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     her had borrowed light:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She came before us wondrous clad in chemisette of green, * As"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     veiled by its leafy screen pomegranate hides from sight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And when he said How callest thou the manner of thy dress? *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     She answered us in pleasant way with double meaning dight;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"We call this garment creve-coeur; and rightly is it hight, * For"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     many a heart wi' this we broke [FN#415] and conquered many
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     a sprite!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then they displayed her in the seventh dress, coloured between"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"safflower [FN#416] and saffron, even as one of the poets saith:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"In vest of saffron pale and safflower red * Musk'd, sandal'd"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     ambergris'd, she came to front:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Rise! cried her youth, go forth and show thyself! * Sit!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     said her hips, we cannot bear the brunt!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And when I craved a bout, her Beauty said * Do, do! and said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     her pretty shame, Don't, don't!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thus they displayed the bride in all her seven toilettes before
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan al-Basri, wholly neglecting the Gobbo who sat moping alone;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, when she opened her eyes [FN#417] she said, O Allah make"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this man my goodman and deliver me from the evil of this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hunchbacked groom. As soon as they had made an end of this part
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the ceremony they dismissed the wedding guests who went forth,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"women, children and all, and none remained save Hasan and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hunchback, whilst the tirewomen led the bride into an inner room"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to change her garb and gear and get her ready for the bridegroom.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thereupon Quasimodo came up to Badr al-Din Hasan and said, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lord, thou hast cheered us this night with thy good company and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,overwhelmed us with thy kindness and courtesy; but now why not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"get thee up and go? Bismallah, he answered, In Allah's name"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so be it! and rising, he went forth by the door, where the Ifrit"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"met him and said, Stay in thy stead, O Badr al-Din, and when the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hunchback goes out to the closet of ease go in without losing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,time and seat thyself in the alcove; and when the bride comes say
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to her, 'Tis I am thy husband, for the King devised this trick"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"only fearing for thee the evil eye, and he whom thou sawest is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but a Syce, a groom, one of our stablemen.' Then walk boldly up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to her and unveil her face; for jealousy hath taken us of this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"matter. While Hasan was still talking with the Ifrit behold,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the groom fared forth from the hall and entering the closet of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ease sat down on the stool. Hardly had he done this when the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ifrit came out of the tank, [FN#418] wherein the water was, in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,semblance of a mouse and squeaked out Zeek! Quoth the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hunchback, What ails thee?; and the mouse grew and grew till it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,became a coal-black cat and caterwauled Meeao! Meeao![FN#419]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then it grew still more and more till it became a dog and barked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out Owh! Owh! When the bridegroom saw this he was frightened
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and exclaimed Out with thee, O unlucky one! [FN#420] But the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dog grew and swelled till it became an ass-colt that brayed and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,snorted in his face Hauk! Hauk! [FN#421] Whereupon the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hunchback quaked and cried, Come to my aid, O people of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house! But behold, the ass-colt grew and became big as a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,buffalo and walled the way before him and spake with the voice of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the sons of Adam, saying, Woe to thee, O thou Bunch-back, thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stinkard, O thou filthiest of grooms! Hearing this the groom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was seized with a colic and he sat down on the jakes in his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,clothes with teeth chattering and knocking together. Quoth the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ifrit, Is the world so strait to thee thou findest none to marry"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"save my lady-love? But as he was silent the Ifrit continued,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Answer me or I will do thee dwell in the dust! By Allah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied the Gobbo, O King of the Buffaloes, this is no fault of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mine, for they forced me to wed her; and verily I wot not that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she had a lover among the buffaloes; but now I repent, first"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before Allah and then before thee. Said the Ifrit to him, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"swear to thee that if thou fare forth from this place, or thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"utter a word before sunrise, I assuredly will wring thy neck."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the sun rises wend thy went and never more return to this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house. So saying, the Ifrit took up the Gobbo bridegroom and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"set him head downwards and feet upwards in the slit of the privy,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"[FN#422] and said to him, I will leave thee here but I shall be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on the look-out for thee till sunrise; and, if thou stir before"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"then, I will seize thee by the feet and dash out thy brains"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,against the wall: so look out for thy life! Thus far concerning
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Hunchback, but as regards Badr al-Din Hasan of Bassorah he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"left the Gobbo and the Ifrit jangling and wrangling and, going"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"into the house, sat him down in the very middle of the alcove;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and behold, in came the bride attended by an old woman who stood"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at the door and said, O Father of Uprightness, [FN#423] arise"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and take what God giveth thee. Then the old woman went away and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the bride, Sitt al-Husn or the Lady of Beauty hight, entered the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"inner part of the alcove broken-hearted and saying in herself,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah I will never yield my person to him; no, not even were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he to take my life! But as she came to the further end she saw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Badr al-Din Hasan and she said, Dearling! Art thou still sitting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"here? By Allah I was wishing that thou wert my bridegroom or, at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"least, that thou and the hunchbacked horse-groom were partners in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me. He replied, O beautiful lady, how should the Syce have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"access to thee, and how should he share in thee with me?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then, quoth she, who is my husband, thou or he? Sitt al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Husn, rejoined Hasan, we have not done this for mere fun,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#424] but only as a device to ward off the evil eye from thee;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for when the tirewomen and singers and wedding guests saw they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beauty being displayed to me, they feared fascination and thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,father hired the horse-groom for ten dinars and a porringer of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,meat to take the evil eye off us; and now he hath received his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hire and gone his gait. When the Lady of Beauty heard these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,words she smiled and rejoiced and laughed a pleasant laugh. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she whispered him, By the Lord thou hast quenched a fire which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tortured me and now, by Allah, O my little dark-haired darling,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,take me to thee and press me to thy bosom! Then she began
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,singing:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah, set thy foot upon my soul; * Since long, long years"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     for this alone I long:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And whisper tale of love in ear of me; * To me 'tis sweeter than
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     the sweetest song!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"No other youth upon my heart shall lie; * So do it often, dear,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and do it long.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then she stripped off her outer gear and she threw open her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chemise from the neck downwards and showed her parts genital and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all the rondure of her hips. When Badr al-Din saw the glorious
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sight his desires were roused, and he arose and doffed her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clothes, and wrapping up in his bag-trousers [FN#425] the purse"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of gold which he had taken from the Jew and which contained the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thousand dinars, he laid it under the edge of the bedding. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he took off his turband and set it upon the settle [FN#426] atop
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of his other clothes, remaining in his skull-cap and fine shirt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of blue silk laced with gold. Whereupon the Lady of Beauty drew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him to her and he did likewise. Then he took her to his embrace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and set her legs round his waist and point-blanked that cannon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#427] placed where it battereth down the bulwark of maidenhead
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and layeth it waste. And he found her a pearl unpierced and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,unthridden and a filly by all men save himself unridden; and he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,abated her virginity and had joyance of her youth in his virility
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and presently he withdrew sword from sheath; and then returned to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the fray right eath; and when the battle and the siege had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"finished, some fifteen assaults he had furnished and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,conceived by him that very night. Then he laid his hand under
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her head and she did the same and they embraced and fell asleep
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in each other's arms, as a certain poet said of such lovers in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Visit thy lover, spurn what envy told; * No envious churl shall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     smile on love ensoul'd.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Merciful Allah made no fairer sight * Than coupled lovers single
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     couch doth hold;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Breast pressing breast and robed in joys their own, * With"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pillowed forearms cast in finest mould:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And when heart speaks to heart with tongue of love, * Folk who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     would part them hammer steel ice-cold:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If a fair friend[FN#428] thou find who cleaves to thee, * Live"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     for that friend, that friend in heart enfold."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O ye who blame for love us lover kind * Say, can ye minister to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     diseasèd mind?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,This much concerning Badr al-Hasan and Sitt al-Husn his cousin;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but as regards the Ifrit, as soon as he saw the twain asleep, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to the Ifritah, Arise, slip thee under the youth and let us"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,carry him back to his place ere dawn overtake us; for the day is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nearhand. Thereupon she came forward and, getting under him as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he lay asleep, took him up clad only in his fine blue shirt,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,leaving the rest of his garments; and ceased not flying (and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ifrit vying with her in flight) till the dawn advised them that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it had come upon them mid-way, and the Muezzin began his call"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from the Minaret, Haste ye to salvation! Haste ye to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,salvation! [FN#429] Then Allah suffered his angelic host to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shoot down the Ifrit with a shooting star, [FN#430] so he was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"consumed, but the Ifritah escaped and she descended with Badr al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Din at the place where the Ifrit was burnt, and did not carry him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"back to Bassorah, fearing lest he come to harm. Now by the order"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of Him who predestineth all things, they alighted at Damascus of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Syria, and the Ifritah set down her burden at one of the city-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gates and flew away. When day arose and the doors were opened,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the folks who came forth saw a handsome youth, with no other"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,raiment but his blue shirt of gold-embroidered silk and skull-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cap,[FN#431] lying upon the ground drowned in sleep after the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hard labour of the night which had not suffered him to take his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rest. So the folk looking at him said, O her luck with whom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this one spent the night! but would he had waited to don his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"garments. Quoth another, A sorry lot are the sons of great"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,families! Haply he but now came forth of the tavern on some
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"occasion of his own and his wine flew to his head,[FN#432]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whereby he hath missed the place he was making for and strayed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till he came to the gate of the city; and finding it shut lay him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down and to by-by! As the people were bandying guesses about
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him suddenly the morning breeze blew upon Badr al-Din and raising
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his shirt to his middle showed a stomach and navel with something
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"below it, [FN#433] and legs and thighs clear as crystal and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"smooth as cream. Cried the people, By Allah he is a pretty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fellow!; and at the cry Badr al-din awoke and found himself
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lying at a city-gate with a crowd gathered around him. At this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he greatly marvelled and asked, Where am I, O good folk; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what causeth you thus to gather round me, and what have I had to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"do with you?; and they answered, We found thee lying here"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,asleep during the call to dawn-prayer and this is all we know of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the matter, but where diddest thou lie last night? [FN#434] By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, O good people, replied he, I lay last night in Cairo."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Said somebody, Thou hast surely been eating Hashish, [FN#435]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and another, He is a fool; and a third, He is a citrouille;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and a fourth asked him, Art thou out of thy mind? thou sleepest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in Cairo and thou wakest in the morning at the gate of Damascus-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"city! [FN#436] Cried he, By Allah, my good people, one and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all, I lie not to you: indeed I lay yesternight in the land of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Egypt and yesternoon I was at Bassorah. Quoth one, Well!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"well!; and quoth another, Ho! ho!; and a third, So! so!; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a fourth cried, This youth is mad, is possessed of the Jinni!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So they clapped hands at him and said to one another, Alas, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pity of it for his youth: by Allah a madman! and madness is no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"respecter of persons. Then they said to him, Collect thy wits"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and return to thy reason! How couldest thou be in Bassorah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,yesterday and Cairo yesternight and withal awake in Damascus this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"morning? But he persisted, Indeed I was a bridegroom in Cairo"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"last night. Belike thou hast been dreaming, rejoined they,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and sawest all this in thy sleep. So Hasan took thought for a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"while and said to them, By Allah, this is no dream; nor vision-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,like doth it seem! I certainly was in Cairo where they displayed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the bride before me, in presence of a third person, the Hunchback"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"groom who was sitting hard by. By Allah, O my brother, this be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"no dream, and if it were a dream, where is the bag of gold I bore"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with me and where are my turband and my robe, and my trousers?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he rose and entered the city, threading its highways and by-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ways and bazar-streets; and the people pressed upon him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"jeered at him, crying out Madman! madman! till he, beside"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself with rage, took refuge in a cook's shop. Now that Cook"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had been a trifle too clever, that is, a rogue and thief; but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah had made him repent and turn from his evil ways and open a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cook-shop; and all the people of Damascus stood in fear of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,boldness and his mischief. So when the crowd saw the youth enter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his shop, they dispersed being afraid of him, and went their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ways. The Cook looked at Badr al-Din and, noting his beauty and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loveliness, fell in love with him forthright and said, Whence"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"comest thou, O youth? Tell me at once thy tale, for thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,become dearer to me than my soul. So Hasan recounted to him all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that had befallen him from beginning to end (but in repetition
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there is no fruition) and the Cook said, O my lord Badr al-Din,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,doubtless thou knowest that this case is wondrous and this story
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marvellous; therefore, O my son, hide what hath betided thee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till Allah dispel what ills be thine; and tarry with me here the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"meanwhile, for I have no child and I will adopt thee. Badr al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Din replied, Be it as thou wilt, O my uncle! Whereupon the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Cook went to the bazar and bought him a fine suit of clothes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made him don it; then fared with him to the Kazi, and formally"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,declared that he was his son. So Badr al-Din Hasan became known
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in Damascus-city as the Cook's son and he sat with him in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shop to take the silver, and on this wise he sojourned there for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a time. Thus far concerning him; but as regards his cousin, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Lady of Beauty, when morning dawned she awoke and missed Badr al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Din Hasan from her side; but she thought that he had gone to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"privy and she sat expecting him for an hour or so; when behold,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered her father Shams al-Din Mohammed, Wazir of Egypt. Now he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was disconsolate by reason of what had befallen him through the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sultan, who had entreated him harshly and had married his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,daughter by force to the lowest of his menials and he too a lump
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of a groom bunch-backed withal, and he said to himself, I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slay this daughter of mine if of her own free will she have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,yielded her person to this acursed carle. So he came to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"door of the bride's private chamber and said, Ho! Sitt al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Husn. She answered him, Here am I! here am I! [FN#437] O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lord, and came out unsteady of gait after the pains and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pleasures of the night; and she kissed his hand, her face showing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,redoubled brightness and beauty for having lain in the arms of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that gazelle, her cousin. When her father, the Wazir, saw her in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"such case, he asked her, O thou accursed, art thou rejoicing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"because of this horse-groom?, and Sitt al-Husn smiled sweetly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and answered, By Allah, don't ridicule me: enough of what passed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yesterday when folk laughed at me, and evened me with that groom-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fellow who is not worthy to bring my husband's shoes or slippers;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nay who is not worth the paring of my husband's nails! By the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Lord, never in my life have I nighted a night so sweet as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yesternight!, so don't mock by reminding me of the Gobbo. When"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her parent heard her words he was filled with fury, and his eyes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"glared and stared, so that little of them showed save the whites"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he cried, Fie upon thee! What words are these? 'Twas the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hunchbacked horse-groom who passed the night with thee! Allah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon thee, replied the Lady of Beauty, do not worry me about"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Gobbo, Allah damn his father; [FN#438] and leave jesting with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me; for this groom was only hired for ten dinars and a porringer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of meat and he took his wage and went his way. As for me I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered the bridal-chamber, where I found my true bridegroom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sitting, after the singer-women had displayed me to him; the same"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who had crossed their hands with red gold, till every pauper that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was present waxed wealthy; and I passed the night on the breast
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of my bonny man, a most lively darling, with his black eyes and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,joined eyebrows. [FN#439] When her parent heard these words the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"light before his face became night, and he cried out at her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, O thou whore! What is this thou tellest me? Where be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy wits? O my father, she rejoined, thou breakest my heart;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,enough for thee that thou hast been so hard upon me! Indeed my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,husband who took my virginity is but just now gone to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,draught-house and I feel that I have conceived by him. [FN#440]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Wazir rose in much marvel and entered the privy where he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"found the hunchbacked groom with his head in the hole, and his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heels in the air. At this sight he was confounded and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"This is none other than he, the rascal Hunchback! So he called"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to him, Ho Hunchback! The Gobbo grunted out, Taghum! Taghum!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#441] thinking it was the Ifrit spoke to him; so the Wazir
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shouted at him and said, Speak out, or I'll strike off thy pate"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with this sword. Then quoth the Hunchback, By Allah, O Shaykh"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the Ifrits, ever since thou settest me in this place, I have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not lifted my head; so Allah upon thee, take pity and entreat me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kindly! When the Wazir heard this he asked, What is this thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sayest? I'm bride's father and no Ifrit. Enough for thee that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou hast well nigh done me die,  answered Quasimodo; now go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy ways before he come upon thee who hath served me thus. Could
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ye not marry me to any save the lady-love of buffaloes and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,beloved of Ifrits? Allah curse her and curse him who married me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to her and was the cause of this my case,--And Shahrazad"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say her permitted say."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Twenty-third Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Said she, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hunchbacked groom spake to the bride's father saying, Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,curse him who was the cause of this my case! Then said the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir to him, Up and out of this place! Am I mad, cried the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"groom, that I should go with thee without leave of the Ifrit"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whose last words to me were:--When the sun rises, arise and go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they gait. So hath the sun risen or no?; for I dare not budge
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from this place till then. Asked the Wazir, Who brought thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hither?; and he answered I came here yesternight for a call of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nature and to do what none can do for me, when lo! a mouse came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out of the water, and squeaked at me and swelled and waxed gross"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till it was big as a buffalo, and spoke to me words that entered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my ears. Then he left me here and went away, Allah curse the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bride and him who married me to her! The Wazir walked up to him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and lifted his head out of the cesspool hole; and he fared forth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,running for dear life and hardly crediting that the sun had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,risen; and repaired to the Sultan to whom he told all that had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,befallen him with the Ifrit. But the Wazir returned to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bride's private chamber, sore troubled in spirit about her, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to her, O my daughter, explain this strange matter to me!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth she, Tis simply this. The bridegroom to whom they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"displayed me yestereve lay with me all night, and took my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,virginity and I am with child by him. He is my husband and if
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou believe me not, there are his turband, twisted as it was,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lying on the settle and his dagger and his trousers beneath the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bed with a something, I wot not what, wrapped up in them. When"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her father heard this he entered the private chamber and found
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the turband which had been left there by Badr al-Din Hasan, his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother's son, and he took it in hand and turned it over, saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"This is the turband worn by Wazirs, save that it is of Mosul"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stuff. [FN#442] So he opened it and, finding what seemed to be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"an amulet sewn up in the Fez, he unsewed the lining and took it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out; then he lifted up the trousers wherein was the purse of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thousand gold pieces and, opening that also, found in it a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,written paper. This he read and it was the sale-receipt of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Jew in the name of Badr al-Din Hasan, son of Nur al-Din Ali, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Egyptian; and the thousand dinars were also there. No sooner had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Shams al-Din read this than he cried out with a loud cry and fell
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to the ground fainting; and as soon as he revived and understood
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the gist of the matter he marvelled and said, There is no God,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but the God, who All-might is over all things! Knowest thou, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my daughter, who it was that became the husband of thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"virginity? No, answered she, and he said, Verily he is the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son of my brother, thy cousin, and this thousand dinars is thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dowry. Praise be to Allah! and would I wot how this matter came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,about! then opened he the amulet which was sewn up and found
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"therein a paper in the handwriting of his deceased brother, Nur"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-Din the Egyptian, father of Badr al-Din Hasan; and, when he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw the hand-writing, he kissed it again and again; and he wept"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and wailed over his dead brother and improvised this lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I see their traces and with pain I melt, * And on their whilome"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     homes I weep and yearn:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And Him I pray who dealt this parting-blow * Some day he deign
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     vouchsafe a safe return. [FN#443]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When he ceased versifying, he read the scroll and found in it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,recorded the dates of his brother's marriage with the daughter of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Wazir of Bassorah, and of his going in to her, and her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"conception, and the birth of Badr al-Din Hasan and all his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brother's history and doings up to his dying day. So he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marvelled much and shook with joy and, comparing the dates with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his own marriage and going in to his wife and the birth of their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"daughter, Sitt al-Husn, he found that they perfectly agreed. So"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he took the document and, repairing with it to the Sultan,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"acquainted him with what had passed, from first to last; whereat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the King marvelled and commanded the case to be at once recorded.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#444] The Wazir abode that day expecting to see his brother's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son but he came not; and he waited a second day, a third day and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so on to the seventh day, without any tidings of him. So he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, By Allah, I will do a deed such as none hath ever done"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before me!; and he took reed-pen and ink and drew upon a sheet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of paper the plan of the whole house, showing whereabouts was the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,private chamber with the curtain in such a place and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,furniture in such another and so on with all that was in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"room. Then he folded up the sketch and, causing all the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"furniture to be collected, he took Badr al-Din's garments and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"turband and Fez and robe and purse, and carried the whole to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house and locked them up, against the coming of his nephew, Badr"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-Din Hasan, the son of his lost brother, with an iron padlock"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on which he set his seal. As for the Wazir's daughter, when her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tale of months was fulfilled, she bare a son like the full moon,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the image of his father in beauty and loveliness and fair
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,proportions and perfect grace. They cut his navel-string
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"[FN#445] and Kohl'd his eyelids to strengthen his eyes, and gave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him over to the nurses and nursery governesses, [FN#446] naming"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him Ajib, the Wonderful. His day was as a month and his month"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was as a year; [FN#447] and, when seven years had passed over"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, his grandfather sent him to school, enjoining the master to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"teach him Koran-reading, and to educate him well. he remained at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the school four years, till he began to bully his schoolfellows"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and abuse them and bash them and thrash them and say, Who among"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,you is like me? I am the son of Wazir of Egypt! At last the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,boys came in a body to the Monitor [FN#448] of what hard usage
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they were wont to have from Ajib, and he said to them, I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tell you somewhat you may do to him so that he shall leave off
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"coming to the school, and it is this. When he enters to-morrow,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sit ye down about him and say some one of you to some other, 'By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah none shall play with us at this game except he tell us the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,names of his mamma and his papa; for he who knows not the names
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of his mother and his father is a bastard, a son of adultery,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#449] and he shall not play with us.' When morning dawned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the boys came to school, Ajib being one of them, and all flocked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"around him saying, We will play a game wherein none can join"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,save he can tell the name of his mamma and his papa. And they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all cried, By Allah, good! Then quoth one of them, My name is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Majid and my mammy's name is Alawiyah and my daddy's Izz al-Din.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Another spoke in like guise and yet a third, till Ajid's turn"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came, and he said, MY name is Ajib, and my mother's is Sitt al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Husn, and my father's Shams al-Din, the Wazir of Cairo. By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, cried they, the Wazir is not thy true father. Ajib"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, The Wazir is my father in very deed. Then the boys"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all laughed and clapped their hands at him, saying He does not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"know who is his papa: get out from among us, for none shall play"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with us except he know his father's name. Thereupon they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dispersed from around him and laughed him to scorn; so his breast
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was straitened and he well nigh choked with tears and hurt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feelings. Then said the Monitor to him, We know that the Wazir"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is thy grandfather, the father of thy mother, Sitt al-Husn, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not thy father. As for thy father, neither dost thou know him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nor yet do we; for the Sultan married thy mother to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hunchbacked horse-groom; but the Jinni came and slept with her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and thou hast no known father. Leave, then, comparing thyself"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"too advantageously with the little ones of the school, till thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,know that thou hast a lawful father; for until then thou wilt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pass for a child of adultery amongst them. Seest thou that not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,even a huckster's son knoweth his own sire? Thy grandfather is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Wazir of Egypt; but as for thy father we wot him not and we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,say indeed that thou hast none. So return to thy sound senses!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When Ajib heard these insulting words from the Monitor and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"school boys and understood the reproach they put upon him, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went out at once and ran to his mother, Sitt al-Husn, to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,complain; but he was crying so bitterly that his tears prevented
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his speech for a while. When she heard his sobs and saw his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tears her heart burned as though with fire for him, and she said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my son, why dost thou weep? Allah keep the tears from thine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eyes! Tell me what hath betided thee? So he told her all that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he heard from the boys and from the Monitor and ended with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asking, And who, O my mother, is my father? She answered, Thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"father is the Wazir of Egypt; but he said, Do not lie to me."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Wazir is thy father, not mine! who then is my father? Except"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou tell me the very truth I will kill myself with this hanger.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"[FN#450] When his mother heard him speak of his father she wept,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,remembering her cousin and her bridal night with him and all that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"occurred thereon and then, and she repeated these couplets:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Love in my heart they lit and went their ways, * And all I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     love to furthest lands withdrew;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And when they left me sufferance also left, * And when we parted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Patience bade adieu:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"They fled and flying with my joys they fled, * In very"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     consistency my spirit flew:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,They made my eyelids flow with severance tears * And to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     parting-pang these drops are due:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And when I long to see reunion-day, * My groans prolonging sore"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     for ruth I sue:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then in my heart of hearts their shapes I trace, * And love and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     longing care and cark renew:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O ye, whose names cling round me like a cloak, * Whose love yet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     closer than a shirt I drew,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Beloved ones! how long this hard despite? * How long this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     severance and this coy shy flight?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then she wailed and shrieked aloud and her son did the like; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"behold, in came the Wazir whose heart burnt within him at the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sight of their lamentations, and he said, What makes you weep?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So the Lady of Beauty acquainted him with what had happened
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"between her son and the school boys; and he also wept, calling to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mind his brother and what had past between them and what had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,betided his daughter and how he had failed to find out what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mystery there was in the matter. Then he rose at once and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"repairing to the audience-hall, went straight to the King and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,told his tale and craved his permission [FN#451] to travel
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eastward to the city of Bassorah and ask after his brother's son.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Furthermore, he besought the Sultan to write for him letters"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"patent, authorising him to seize upon Badr al-Din, his nephew and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son-in-law, wheresoever he might find him. And he wept before"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King, who had pity on him and wrote royal autographs to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,deputies in all climes [FN#452] and countries and cities; whereat
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Wazir rejoiced and prayed for blessings on him. Then, taking"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leave of his Sovereign, he returned to his house, where he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"equipped himself and his daughter and his adopted child Ajib,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with all things meet for a long march; and set out and travelled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the first day and the second and the third and so forth till he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,arrived at Damascus-city. He found it a fair place abounding in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"trees and streams, even as the poet said of it:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I nighted and dayed in Damascus town, * Time sware such"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     another he ne'er should view:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And careless we slept under wing of night, * Till dappled Morn"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     'gan her smiles renew:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And dew-drops on branch in their beauty hung, * Like pearls to be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     dropt when the Zephyr blew:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And the Lake [FN#453] was the page where birds read and note, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     And the clouds set points to what breezes wrote.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Wazir encamped on the open space called Al-Hasa; [FN#454]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, after pitching tents, said to his servants, A halt here for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,two days! So they went into the city upon their several
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"occasions, this to sell and this to buy; this to go to the Hammam"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and that to visit the Cathedral-mosque of the Banu Umayyah, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ommiades, whose like is not in this world. [FN#455] Ajib also"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went, with his attendant eunuch, for solace and diversion to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,city and the servant followed with a quarter-staff [FN#456] of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,almond-wood so heavy that if he struck a camel therewith the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,beast would never rise again. [FN#457] When the people of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Damascus saw Ajib's beauty and brilliancy and perfect grace and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,symmetry (for he was a marvel of comeliness and winning
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loveliness, softer than the cool breeze of the North, sweeter"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than limpid waters to a man in drowth, and pleasanter than the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"health for which sick man sueth), a mighty many followed him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whilest others ran on before, and sat down on the road until he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"should come up, that they might gaze on him, till, as Destiny had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"decreed, the Eunuch stopped opposite the shop of Ajib's father,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Badr al-Din Hasan. Now his beard had grown long and thick and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his wits had ripened during the twelve years which had passed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"over him, and the Cook and ex-rogue having died, the so-called"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan of Bassorah had succeeded to his goods and shop, for that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he had been formally adopted before the Kazi and witnesses. When
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his son and the Eunuch stepped before him he gazed on Ajib and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seeing how very beautiful he was, his heart fluttered and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"throbbed, and blood drew to blood and natural affection spake out"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and his bowels yearned over him. He had just dressed a conserve
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of pomegranate-grains with sugar, and Heaven-implanted love"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wrought within him; so he called to his son Ajib and said, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lord, O thou who hast gotten the mastery of my heart and my very"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"vitals and to whom my bowels yearn; say me, wilt thou enter my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,house and solace my soul by eating of my meat? Then his eyes
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"streamed with tears which he could not stay, for he bethought him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of what he had been and what he had become. When Ajib heard his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,father's words his heart also yearned himwards and he looked at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Eunuch and said to him, Of a truth, O my good guard, my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heart yearns to this cook; he is as one that hath a son far away
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from him: so let us enter and gladden his heart by tasting of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hospitality. Perchance for our so doing Allah may reunite me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with my father. When the Eunuch heard these words he cried, A"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fine thing this, by Allah! Shall the sons of Wazirs be seen"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eating in a common cook-shop? Indeed I keep off the folk from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee with this quarter-staff lest they even look upon thee; and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dare not suffer thee to enter this shop at all. When Hasan of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Bassorah heard his speech he marvelled and turned to the Eunuch
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with the tears pouring down his cheeks; and Ajib said, Verily my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heart loves him! But he answered, Leave this talk, thou shalt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not go in. Thereupon the father turned to the Eunuch and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O worthy sir, why wilt thou not gladden my soul by entering my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shop? O thou who art like a chestnut, dark without but white of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heart within! O thou of the like of whom a certain poet said * *
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,* The Eunuch burst out a-laughing and asked--Said what? Speak
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out by Allah and be quick about it. So Hasan the Bassorite
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,began reciting these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,If not master of manners or aught but discreet * In the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     household of Kings no trust could he take:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And then for the Harem! what Eunuch [FN#458] is he * Whom
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     angels would serve for his service sake.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Eunuch marvelled and was pleased at these words, so he took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Ajib by the hand and went into the cook's shop: whereupon Hasan
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Bassorite ladled into a saucer some conserve of pomegranate-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grains wonderfully good, dressed with almonds and sugar, saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,You have honoured me with your company: eat then and health and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"happiness to you! Thereupon Ajib said to his father, Sit thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down and eat with us; so perchance Allah may unite us with him we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"long for. Quoth Hasan, O my son, hast thou then been afflicted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in thy tender years with parting from those thou lovest? Quoth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ajib, Even so, O nuncle mine; my heart burns for the loss of a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,beloved one who is non other than my father; and indeed I come
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forth, I and my grandfather, [FN#459] to circle and search the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"world for him. Oh, the pity of it, and how I long to meet him!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he wept with exceeding for his own bereavement, which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,recalled to him his long separation from dear friends and from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his mother; and the Eunuch was moved to pity for him. Then they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ate together till they were satisfied; and Ajib and the slave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rose and left the shop. Hereat Hasan the Bassorite felt as
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,though his soul had departed his body and had gone with them; for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he could not lose sight of the boy during the twinkling of an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eye, albeit he knew not that Ajib was his son. So he locked up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his shop and hastened after them; and he walked so fast that he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came up with them before they had gone out of the western gate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Eunuch turned and asked him, What ails the?; and Badr al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Din answered, When ye went from me, meseemed my soul had gone"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with you; and, as I had business without the city-gate, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,purposed to bear you company till my matter was ordered and so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"return. The Eunuch was angered and said to Ajib, This is just"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what I feared! we ate that unlucky mouthful (which we are bound
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to respect), and here is the fellow following us from place to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"place; for the vulgar are ever the vulgar. Ajib, turning and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seeing the Cook just behind him, was wroth and his face reddened"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with rage and he said to the servant; Let him walk the highway
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the Moslems; but, when we turn off it to our tents, and find"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that he still follows us, we will send him about his business"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with a flea in his ear. Then he bowed his head and walked on,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Eunuch walking behind him. But Hasan of Bassorah followed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them to the plain Al-Hasa; and, as they drew near to the tents,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they turned round and saw him close on their heels; so Ajib was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"very angry, fearing that the Eunuch might tell his grandfather"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what had happened. His indignation was the hotter for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,apprehension lest any say that after he had entered a cook-shop
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the cook had followed him. So he turned and looked at Hasan of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bassorah and found his eyes fixed on his own, for the father had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,become a body without a soul; and it seemed to Ajib that his eye
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was a treacherous eye or that he was some lewd fellow. So his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rage redoubled and, stooping down, he took up a stone weighing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,half a pound and threw it at his father. It struck him on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forehead, cutting it open from eye-brow to eye-brow and causing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the blood to stream down: and Hasan fell to the ground in a swoon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whilst Ajib and the Eunuch made for the tents. When the father
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came to himself he wiped away the blood and tore off a strip from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his turband and bound up his head, blaming himself the while, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, I wronged the lad by shutting up my shop and following,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so that he thought I was some evil-minded fellow. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,returned to his place where he busied himself with the sale of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his sweetmeats; and he yearned after his mother at Bassorah, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wept over her and broke out repeating:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Unjust it were to bid the World [FN#460] be just * And blame
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     her not: She ne'er was made for justice:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Take what she gives thee, leave all grief aside, * For now to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fair and then to foul her lust is.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So Hasan of Bassorah set himself steadily to sell his sweetmeats;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but the Wazir, his uncle, halted in Damascus three days and then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marched upon Emesa, and passing through that town he made enquiry"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there and at every place where he rested. Thence he fared on by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,way of Hamah and Aleppo and thence to Diyar Bakr and Maridin and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Mosul, still enquiring, till he arrived at Bassorah-city. Here,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as soon as he had secured a lodging, he presented himself before"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Sultan, who entreated him with high honour and the respect"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"due to his rank, and asked the cause of his coming. The Wazir"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,acquainted him with his history and told him that the Minister
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nur al-Din was his brother; whereupon the Sultan exclaimed,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah have mercy upon him! and added, My good Sahib!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#461]; he was my Wazir for fifteen years and I loved him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,exceedingly. Then he died leaving a son who abode only a single
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,month after his father's death; since which time he has
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"disappeared and we could gain no tidings of him. But his mother,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who is the daughter of my former Minister, is still among us."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When the Wazir Shams al-Din heard that his nephew's mother was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"alive and well, he rejoiced and said, O King I much desire to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,meet her. The King on the instant gave him leave to visit her;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so he betook himself to the mansion of his brother, Nur al-Din,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and cast sorrowful glances on all things in and around it and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kissed the threshold. Then he bethought him of his brother, Nur"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-Din Ali, and how he had died in a strange land far from kith"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and kin and friends; and he wept and repeated these lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I wander 'mid these walls, my Layla's walls, * And kissing this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and other wall I roam:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"'Tis not the walls or roof my heart so loves, * But those who in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     this house had made their home.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he passed through the gate into a courtyard and found a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,vaulted doorway builded of hardest syenite [FN#462] inlaid with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sundry kinds of multi-coloured marble. Into this he walked and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wandered about the house and, throwing many a glance around, saw"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the name of his brother, Nur al-Din, written in gold wash upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the walls. So he went up to the inscription and kissed it and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wept and thought of how he had been separated from his brother
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and had now lost him for ever, and he recited these couplets:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I ask of you from every rising sun, * And eke I ask when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     flasheth levenlight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I pass my nights in passion-pain, * Yet ne'er I 'plain me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     of my painful plight;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,My love! if longer last this parting throe * Little by little
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     shall it waste my sprite.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,An thou wouldst bless these eyne with sight of thee * One day on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     earth, I crave none other sight:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Think not another could possess my mind * Nor length nor breadth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     for other love I find.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he walked on till he came to the apartment of his brother's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"widow, the mother of Badr al-Din Hasan, the Egyptian. Now from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the time of her son's disappearance she had never ceased weeping
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and wailing through the light hours and the dark; and, when the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"years grew longsome with her, she built for him a tomb of marble"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in the midst of the saloon and there used to weep for him day and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night, never sleeping save thereby. When the Wazir drew near her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"apartment, he heard her voice and stood behind the door while she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,addressed the sepulchre in verse and said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Answer, by Allah! Sepulchre, are all his beauties gone? * Hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     change the power to blight his charms, that Beauty's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     paragon?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou art not earth, O Sepulchre! nor art thou sky to me; * How"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     comes it, then, in thee I see conjoint the branch and moon?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"While she was bemoaning herself after this fashion, behold, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wazir went in to her and saluted her and informed her that he was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her husband's brother; and, telling her all that had passed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"between them, laid open before her the whole story, how her son"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Badr al-Din Hasan had spent a whole night with his daughter full
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ten years ago but had disappeared in the morning. And he ended
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with saying, My daughter conceived by thy son and bare a male"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"child who is now with me, and he is thy son and thy son's son by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my daughter. When she heard the tidings that her boy, Badr al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Din, was still alive and saw her brother-in-law, she rose up to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him and threw herself at his feet and kissed them, reciting these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah be good to him that gives glad tidings of thy steps; * In
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     very sooth for better news mine ears would never sue:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Were he content with worn-out robe, upon his back I'd throw * A"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     heart to pieces rent and torn when heard the word Adieu.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then the Wazir sent for Ajib and his grandmother stood up and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell on his neck and wept; but Shams al-Din said to her, This is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,no time for weeping; this is the time to get thee ready for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,travelling with us to the land of Egypt; haply Allah will reunite
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me and thee with thy son and my nephew. Replied she,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hearkening and obedience; and, rising at once, collected her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"baggage and treasures and her jewels, and equipped herself and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her slave-girls for the march, whilst the Wazir went to take his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leave of the Sultan of Bassorah, who sent by him presents and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rarities for the Soldan of Egypt. Then he set out at once upon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his homeward march and journeyed till he came to Damascus-city
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"where he alighted in the usual place and pitched tents, and said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to his suite, We will halt a se'nnight here to buy presents and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rare things for the Soldan. Now Ajib bethought him of the past
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so he said to the Eunuch, O Laik, I want a little diversion;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"come, let us go down to the great bazar of Damascus, [FN#463] and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,see what hath become of the cook whose sweetmeats we ate and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whose head we broke, for indeed he was kind to us and we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entreated him scurvily. The Eunuch answered, Hearing is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,obeying! So they went forth from the tents; and the tie of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blood drew Ajib towards his father, and forthwith they passed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"through the gateway, Bab al-Faradis [FN#464] hight, and entered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the city and ceased not walking through the streets till they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reached the cookshop, where they found Hasan of Bassorah standing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at the door. It was near the time of mid-afternoon prayer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#465] and it so fortuned that he had just dressed a confection
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of pomegranate-grains. When the twain drew near to him and Ajib
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw him, his heart yearned towards him, and noticing the scar of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the blow, which time had darkened on his brow, he said to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Peace be on thee, O man! [FN#466] know that my heart is with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee. But when Badr al-Din looked upon his son his vitals
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yearned and his heart fluttered, and he hung his head earthwards"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and sought to make his tongue give utterance to his words, but he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,could not. Then he raised his head humbly and suppliant-wise
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,towards his boy and repeated these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I longed for my beloved but when I saw his face, * Abashed I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     held my tongue and stood with downcast eye;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And hung my head in dread and would have hid my love, * But do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     whatso I would hidden it would not lie;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Volumes of plaints I had prepared, reproach and blame, * But"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     when we met, no single word remembered I."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And then said he to them, Heal my broken heart and eat of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sweetmeats; for, by Allah, I cannot look at thee but my heart"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"flutters. Indeed I should not have followed thee the other day,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but that I was beside myself. By Allah, answered Ajib, thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dost indeed love us! We ate in thy house a mouthful when we were
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"here before and thou madest us repent of it, for that thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,followedst us and wouldst have disgraced us; so now we will not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eat aught with thee save on condition that thou make oath not to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,go out after us nor dog us. Otherwise we will not visit thee
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again during our present stay; for we shall halt a week here,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whilst my grandfather buys certain presents for the King. Quoth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan of Bassorah, I promise you this. So Ajib and the Eunuch"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered the shop, and his father set before them a saucer-full of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"conserve of pomegranate-grains. Said Ajib, Sit thee down and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eat with us, so haply shall Allah dispel our sorrows. Hasan the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Bassorite was joyful and sat down and ate with them; but his eyes
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kept gazing fixedly on Ajib's face, for his very heart and vitals"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clove to him; and at last the boy said to him, Did I not tell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee thou art a most noyous dotard?; so do stint thy staring in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my face! But when Hasan of Bassorah heard his son's words he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,repeated these lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou hast some art the hearts of men to clip; * Close-veiled,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     far-hidden mystery dark and deep:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O thou whose beauties sham the lustrous moon, * Wherewith the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     saffron Morn fears rivalship!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thy beauty is a shrine shall ne'er decay; * Whose signs shall
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     grow until they all outstrip; [FN#467]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Must I be thirst-burnt by that Eden-brow * And die of pine to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     taste that Kausar-lip? [FN#468]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hasan kept putting morsels into Ajib's mouth at one time and at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,another time did the same by the Eunuch and they ate till they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,were satisfied and could no more. Then all rose up and the cook
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"poured water on their hands; [FN#469] and, loosing a silken"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waist-shawl, dried them and sprinkled them with rose-water from a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,casting-bottle he had by him. Then he went out and presently
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned with a gugglet of sherbet flavoured with rose-water,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,scented with musk and cooled with snow; and he set this before
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them saying, Complete your kindness to me! So Ajib took the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gugglet and drank and passed it to the Eunuch; and it went round
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till their stomachs were full and they were surfeited with a meal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,larger than their wont. Then they went away and made haste in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"walking till they reached the tents, and Ajib went in to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grandmother, who kissed him and, thinking of her son, Badr al-Din"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan, groaned aloud and wept and recited these lines:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I still had hoped to see thee and enjoy thy sight, * For in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thine absence life has lost its kindly light:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I swear my vitals wot none other love but thine * By Allah, who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     can read the secrets of the sprite!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then she asked Ajib, O my son! where hast thou been?; and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, In Damascus-city; Whereupon she rose and set before"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him a bit of scone and a saucer of conserve of pomegranate-grains
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"(which was too little sweetened), and she said to the Eunuch,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sit down with thy master! Said the servant to himself, By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, we have no mind to eat: I cannot bear the smell of bread;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but he sat down and so did Ajib, though his stomach was full of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what he had eaten already and drunken. Nevertheless he took a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bit of the bread and dipped it in the pomegranate-conserve and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made shift to eat it, but he found it too little sweetened, for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he was cloyed and surfeited, so he said, Faugh; what be this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wild-beast [FN#470] stuff? O my son, cried his grandmother,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dost thou find fault with my cookery? I cooked this myself and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"none can cook it as nicely as I can save thy father, Badr al-Din"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan. By Allah, O my lady, Ajib answered, this dish is nasty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stuff; for we saw but now in the city of Bassorah a cook who so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dresseth pomegranate-grains that the very smell openeth a way to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the heart and the taste would make a full man long to eat; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as for this mess compared with his, 'tis not worth either much or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,little. When his grandmother heard his words she waxed wroth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with exceeding wrath and looked at the servant--And Shahrazad
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Twenty-fourth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Ajib's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grandmother heard his words, she waxed wroth and looked at the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"servant and said, Woe to thee! dost thou spoil my son, [FN#471]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and dost take him into common cookshops? The Eunuch was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"frightened and denied, saying, We did not go into the shop; we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"only passed by it. By Allah, cried Ajib, but we did go in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and we ate till it came out of our nostrils, and the dish was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,better than thy dish! Then his grandmother rose and went and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"told her brother-in-law, who was incensed against the Eunuch, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sending for him asked him, Why didst thou take my son into a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cookshop?; and the Eunuch being frightened answered, We did not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"go in. But Ajib said, We did go inside and ate conserve of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pomegranate-grains till we were full; and the cook gave us to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drink of iced and sugared sherbet. At this the Wazir's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"indignation redoubled and he questioned the Castrato but, as he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"still denied, the Wazir said to him, If thou speak sooth, sit"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"down and eat before us. So he came forward and tried to eat,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but could not eat and threw away the mouthful crying O my lord!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I am surfeited since yesterday. By this the Wazir was certified
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that he had eaten at the cook's and bade the slaves throw him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#472] which they did. Then they came down on him with a rib-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,basting which burned him till he cried for mercy and help from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, saying, O my master, beat me no more and I will tell thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the truth; whereupon the Wazir stopped the bastinado and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now speak thou sooth. Quoth the Eunuch, Know then that we did"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,enter the shop of a cook while he was dressing conserve of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pomegranate-grains and he set some of it before us: by Allah! I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"never ate in my life its like, nor tasted aught nastier than this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stuff which is now before us.[FN#473] Badr al-Din Hasan's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mother was angry at this and said, Needs thou must go back to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the cook and bring me a saucer of conserved pomegranate-grains
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from that which is in his shop and show it to thy master, that he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"may say which be the better and the nicer, mine or his. Said the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unsexed, I will. So on the instant she gave him a saucer and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"half dinar and he returned to the shop and said to the cook, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shaykh of all Cooks, [FN#474] we have laid a wager concerning thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cookery in my lord's house, for they have conserve of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pomegranate-grains there also; so give me this half-dinar's worth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and look to it; for I have eaten a full meal of stick on account
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of thy cookery, and so do not let me eat aught more thereof."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan of Bassorah laughed and answered, By Allah, none can dress"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this dish as it should be dressed save myself and my mother, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she at this time is in a far country. Then he ladled out a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saucer-full; and, finishing it off with musk and rose-water, put"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it in a cloth which he sealed [FN#475] and gave it to the Eunuch,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who hastened back with it. No sooner had Badr al-Din Hasan's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mother tasted it and perceived its fine flavour and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"excellence of the cookery, than she knew who had dressed it, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she screamed and fell down fainting. The Wazir, sorely started,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sprinkled rose-water upon her and after a time she recovered and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, If my son be yet of this world, none dressed this conserve"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of pomegranate-grains but he; and this Cook is my very son Badr
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,al-Din Hasan; there is no doubt of it nor can there be any
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mistake, for only I and he knew how to prepare it and I taught"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him. When the Wazir heard her words he joyed with exceeding joy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, O the longing of me for a sight of my brother's son!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I wonder if the days will ever unite us with him! Yet it is to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Almighty Allah alone that we look for bringing about this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"meeting. Then he rose without stay or delay and, going to his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"suite said to them, Be off, some fifty of you with sticks and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,staves to the Cook's shop and demolish it; then pinion his arms
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"behind him with his own turband, saying, 'It was thou madest that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,foul mess of pomegranate-grains!' and drag him here perforce but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"without doing him a harm. And they replied, It is well. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Wazir rode off without losing an instant to the Palace and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"foregathering with the Viceroy of Damascus, showed him the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Sultan's orders. After careful perusal he kissed the letter, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"placing it upon his head said to his visitor, Who is this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"offender of thine? Quoth the Wazir, A man who is a cook. So"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Viceroy at once sent his apparitors to the shop; which they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,found demolished and everything in it broken to pieces; for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whilst the Wazir was riding to the palace his men had done his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bidding. Then they awaited his return from the audience, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hasan of Bassorah who was their prisoner kept saying, I wonder"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what they have found in the conserve of pomegranate-grains to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bring things to this pass! [FN#476] When the Wazir returned to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them, after his visit to the Viceroy who had given him formal"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"permission to take up his debtor and depart with him, on entering"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the tents he called for the Cook. They brought him forward
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pinioned with his turband; and, when Badr al-Din Hasan saw his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"uncle, he wept with excessive weeping and said, O my lord, what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is my offence against thee? Art thou the man who dressed that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"conserve of pomegranate-grains?; asked the Wazir, and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,answered Yes! didst thou find in it aught to call for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cutting off of my head? Quoth the Wazir, That were the least"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of thy deserts! Quoth the cook, O my lord, wilt thou not tell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me my crime and what aileth the conserve of pomegranate-grains?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Presently, replied the Wazir and called aloud to his men,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Bring hither the camels. So they struck the tents and by the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir's orders the servants took Badr al-Din Hasan, and set him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in a chest which they padlocked and put on a camel. Then they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"departed and stinted not journeying till nightfall, when they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"halted and ate some victual, and took Badr al-Din Hasan out of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his chest and gave him a meal and locked him up again. They set
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out once more and travelled till they reached Kimrah, where they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took him out of the box and brought him before the Wazir who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asked him, Art thou he who dressed that conserve of pomegranate-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grains? He answered Yes, O my lord!; and the Wazir said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Fetter him! So they fettered him and returned him to the chest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and fared on again till they reached Cairo and lighted at the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,quarter called Al-Raydaniyah.[FN#477] Then the Wazir gave order
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to take Badr al-Din Hasan out of the chest and sent for a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carpenter and said to him, Make me a cross of wood [FN#478] for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this fellow! Cried Badr al-Din Hasan And what wilt thou do with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it?; and the Wazir replied, I mean to crucify thee thereon, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nail thee thereto and parade thee all about the city. And why
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wilt thou use me after this fashion? Because of thy villanous
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cookery of conserved pomegranate-grains; how durst thou dress it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and sell it lacking pepper? And for that it lacked pepper wilt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou do all this to me? Is it not enough that thou hast broken
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my shop and smashed my gear and boxed me up in a chest and fed me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,only once a day? Too little pepper! too little pepper! this is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a crime which can be expiated only upon the cross! Then Badr
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,al-Din Hasan marvelled and fell a-mourning for his life;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereupon the Wazir asked him, Of what thinkest thou?; and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered him, Of maggoty heads like thine; [FN#479] for an thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had one ounce of sense thou hadst not treated me thus. Quoth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Wazir, It is our duty to punish thee lest thou do the like"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again. Quoth Badr al-Din Hasan, Of a truth my offense were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,over-punished by the least of what thou hast already done to me;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and Allah damn all conserve of pomegranate-grains and curse the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hour when I cooked it and would I had died ere this! But the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir rejoined, There is no help for it; I must crucify a man"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who sells conserve of pomegranate-grains lacking pepper. All
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this time the carpenter was shaping the wood and Badr al-Din
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"looked on; and thus they did till night, when his uncle took him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and clapped him into the chest, saying, The thing shall be done"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to-morrow! Then he waited until he knew Badr al-Din Hasan to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be asleep, when he mounted; and taking the chest up before him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered the city and rode on to his own house, where he alighted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said to his daughter, Sitt al-Husn, Praised be Allah who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hath reunited thee with thy husband, the son of thine uncle! Up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"now, and order the house as it was on thy bridal night. So the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,servants arose and lit the candles; and the Wazir took out his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"plan of the nuptial chamber, and directed them what to do till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they had set everything in its stead, so that whoever saw it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would have no doubt but it was the very night of the marriage.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he bade them put down Badr al-Din Hasan's turband on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"settle, as he had deposited it with his own hand, and in like"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,manner his bag-trousers and the purse which were under the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mattress: and told daughter to undress herself and go to bed in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the private chamber as on her wedding-night, adding, When the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son of thine uncle comes in to thee, say to him:--Thou hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loitered while going to the privy; and call him to lie by thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"side and keep him in converse till daybreak, when we will explain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the whole matter to him. Then he bade take Badr al-Din Hasan
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out of the chest, after loosing the fetters from his feet and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stripping off all that was on him save the fine shirt of blue
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,silk in which he had slept on his wedding-night; so that he was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,well-nigh naked and trouserless. All this was done whilst he was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sleeping on utterly unconscious. Then, by doom of Destiny, Badr"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-Din Hasan turned over and awoke; and, finding himself in a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lighted vestibule, said to himself, Surely I am in the mazes of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,some dream. So he rose and went on to a little to an inner door
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and looked in and lo! he was in the very chamber wherein the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bride had been displayed to him; and there he saw the bridal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,alcove and the settle and his turband and all his clothes. When
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he saw this he was confounded and kept advancing with one foot,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and retiring with the other, saying, Am I sleeping or waking?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And he began rubbing his forehead and saying (for indeed he was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thoroughly astounded), By Allah, verily this is the chamber of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the bride who was displayed before me! Where am I then? I was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"surely but now in a box! Whilst he was talking with himself,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Sitt al-Husn suddenly lifted the corner of the chamber-curtain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, O my lord, wilt thou not come in? Indeed thou hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loitered long in the water-closet. When he heard her words and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw her face he burst out laughing and said, Of a truth this is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a very nightmare among dreams! Then he went in sighing, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pondered what had come to pass with him and was perplexed about
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his case, and his affair became yet more obscure to him when he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw his turband and bag-trousers and when, feeling the pocket, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,found the purse containing the thousand gold pieces. So he stood
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"still and muttered, Allah is all knowing! Assuredly I am"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dreaming a wild waking dream! Then said the Lady of Beauty to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, What ails thee to look puzzled and perplexed?; adding,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thou wast a very different man during the first of the night!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"He laughed and asked her, How long have I been away from thee?;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she answered him, Allah preserve thee and His Holy Name be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,about thee! Thou didst but go out an hour ago for an occasion
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and return. Are thy wits clean gone? When Badr al-Din Hasan
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard this, he laughed, [FN#480] and said, Thou hast spoken"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"truth; but, when I went out from thee, I forgot myself awhile in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the draught-house and dreamed that I was a cook at Damascus and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,abode there ten years; and there came to me a boy who was of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sons of the great, and with him an Eunuch. Here he passed his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hand over his forehead and, feeling the scar, cried, By Allah, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my lady, it must have been true, for he struck my forehead with a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stone and cut it open from eye-brow to eye-brow; and here is the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mark: so it must have been on wake. Then he added, But perhaps"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I dreamt it when we fell asleep, I and thou, in each other's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arms, for meseems it was as though I travelled to Damascus"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,without tarbush and trousers and set up as a cook there. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he was perplexed and considered for awhile, and said, By Allah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I also fancied that I dressed a conserve of pomegranate-grains
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and put too little pepper in it. By Allah, I must have slept in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the numerocent and have seen the whole thing in a dream; but how
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"long was that dream! Allah upon thee, said Sitt al-Husn, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what more sawest thou? So he related all to her; and presently
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, By Allah had I not woke up they would have nailed me to a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cross of wood! Wherefore? asked she; and he answered, For"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"putting too little pepper in the conserve of pomegranate-grains,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and meseemed they demolished my shop and dashed to pieces my pots
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and pans, destroyed all my stuff and put me in a box; they then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sent for the carpenter to fashion a cross for me and would have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crucified me thereon. Now Alham-dolillah! thanks be to Allah, for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that all this happened to me in sleep, and not on wake. Sitt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,al-Husn laughed and clasped him to her bosom and he her to his:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"then he thought again and said, By Allah, it could not be save"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,while I was awake: truly I know not what to think of it. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he lay him down and all the night he was bewildered about his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"case, now saying, I was dreaming! and then saying, I was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"awake!, till morning, when his uncle Shams al-Din, the Wazir,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came to him and saluted him. When Badr al-Din Hasan saw him he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, By Allah, art thou not he who bade bind my hands behind me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and smash my shop and nail me to a cross on a matter of conserved
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pomegranate-grains because the dish lacked a sufficiency of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pepper? Whereupon the Wazir said to him, Know, O my son, that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,truth hath shown it soothfast and the concealed hath been
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"revealed! [FN#481] Thou art the son of my brother, and I did all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this with thee to certify myself that thou wast indeed he who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went in unto my daughter that night. I could not be sure of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this, till I saw that thou knewest the chamber and thy turband"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and thy trousers and thy gold and the papers in thy writing and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in that of thy father, my brother; for I had never seen thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,afore that and knew thee not; and as to thy mother I have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prevailed upon her to come with me from Bassorah. So saying, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,threw himself on his nephew's breast and wept for joy; and Badr
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-Din Hasan, hearing these words from his uncle, marvelled with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,exceeding marvel and fell on his neck and also shed tears for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"excess of delight. Then said the Wazir to him, O my son, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sole cause of all this is what passed between me and thy sire;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and all that had occurred to part them. Lastly the Wazir sent
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for Ajib; and when his father saw him he cried, And this is he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who struck me with the stone! Quoth the Wazir, This is thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,son! And Badr al-Din Hasan threw himself upon his boy and began
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,repeating:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Long have I wept o'er severance ban and bane, * Long from mine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     eyelids tear-rills rail and rain:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And vowed I if Time re-union bring * My tongue from name of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Severance I'll restrain:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Joy hath o'ercome me to this stress that I * From joy's revulsion
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     to shed tears am fain:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ye are so trained to tears, O eyne of me! * You weep with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pleasure as you weep with pain. [FN#482]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When he had ended his verse his mother came in and threw herself
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon him and began reciting:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When we met we complained, * Our hearts were sore wrung:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,But plaint is not pleasant * Fro' messenger's tongue.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then she wept and related to him what had befallen her since his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"departure, and he told her what he had suffered, and they thanked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah Almighty for their reunion. Two days after his arrival the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Wazir Shams al-din went in to the Sultan and, kissing the ground"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"between his hands, greeted him with the greeting due to Kings."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Sultan rejoiced at his return and his face brightened and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"placing him hard by his side, [FN#483] asked him to relate all he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had seen in his wayfaring and whatso had betided him in his going
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and coming. So the Wazir told him all that had passed from first
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to last and the Sultan said, Thanks be to Allah for thy victory"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#484] and the winning of thy wish and thy safe return to thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,children and thy people! And now I needs must see the son of thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother, Hasan of Bassorah, so bring him to the audience-hall to-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"morrow. Shams al-Din replied, Thy slave shall stand in thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"presence to-morrow, Inshallah, if it be God's will. Then he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saluted him and, returning to his own house, informed his nephew"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the Sultan's desire to see him, whereto replied Hasan, whilome"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Bassorite, The slave is obedient to the orders of his lord."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And the result was that next day he accompanied his uncle, Shams"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-Din, to the Divan; and, after saluting the Sultan and doing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him reverence in most ceremonious obeisance and with most courtly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"obsequiousness, he began improvising these verses:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The first in rank to kiss the ground shall deign * Before you,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and all ends and aims attain:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"You are Honour's fount; and all that hope of you, * Shall gain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     more honour than Hope hoped to gain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Sultan smiled and signed to him to sit down. So he took a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seat close to his uncle, Shams al-Din, and the King asked him his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"name. Quoth Badr al-Din Hasan, The meanest of thy slaves is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"known as Hasan the Bassorite, who is instant in prayer for thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"day and night. The Sultan was pleased at his words and, being"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"minded to test his learning and prove his good breeding, asked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, Dost thou remember any verses in praise of the mole on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cheek? He answered, I do, and began reciting:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I think of my love and our parting-smart, * My groans go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     forth and my tears upstart:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,He's a mole that reminds me in colour and charms * O' the black
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     o' the eye and the grain [FN#485] of the heart.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The King admired and praised the two couplets and said to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Quote something else; Allah bless thy sire and may thy tongue
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,never tire! So he began:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"That cheek-mole's spot they evened with a grain * Of musk, nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     did they here the simile strain:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nay, marvel at the face comprising all * Beauty, nor falling"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     short by single grain.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The King shook with pleasure [FN#486] and said to him, Say more:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah bless thy days! So he began:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,O you whose mole on cheek enthroned recalls * A dot of musk
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     upon a stone of ruby,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Grant me your favours! Be not stone at heart! * Core of my heart
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     whose only sustenance you be!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth the King, Fair comparison, O Hasan! [FN#487] thou hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,spoken excellently well and hast proved thyself accomplished in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,every accomplishment! Now explain to me how many meanings be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there in the Arabic language [FN#488] for the word Khal or mole.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"He replied, Allah keep the King! Seven and fifty and some by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tradition say fifty. Said the Sultan, Thou sayest sooth,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"presently adding, Hast thou knowledge as to the points of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"excellence in beauty? Yes, answered Badr al-Din Hasan,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Beauty consisteth in brightness of face, clearness of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"complexion, shapeliness of nose, gentleness of eyes, sweetness of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mouth, cleverness of speech, slenderness of shape and seemliness"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of all attributes. But the acme of beauty is in the hair and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"indeed, al-Shihab the Hijazi hath brought together all these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"items in his doggrel verse of the metre Rajaz, [FN#489] and it is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Say thou to skin Be soft, to face Be fair, * And gaze, nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     shall they blame howso thou stare:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Fine nose in Beauty's list is high esteemed; * Nor less an eye
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     full, bright and debonnair:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Eke did they well to laud the lovely lips * (Which e'en the sleep
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     of me will never spare);
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"A winning tongue, a stature tall and straight; [FN#490] * A"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     seemly union of gifts rarest rare:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,But Beauty's acme in the hair one views it; * So hear my strain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and with some few excuse it!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Sultan was captivated by his converse and, regarding him as a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"friend, asked, What meaning is there in the saw 'Shurayh is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"foxier than the fox'? And he answered, Know, O King (whom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Almighty Allah keep!) that the legist Shurayh [FN#491] was wont,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"during the days of the plague, to make a visitation to Al-Najaf;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, whenever he stood up to pray, there came a fox which would"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"plant himself facing him and which, by mimicking his movements,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,distracted him from his devotions. Now when this became longsome
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to him, one day he doffed his shirt and set it upon a cane and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shook out the sleeves; then placing his turband on the top and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"girding its middle with a shawl, he stuck it up in the place"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where he used to pray. Presently up trotted the fox according to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his custom and stood over against the figure, whereupon Shurayh"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came behind him, and took him. Hence the sayer saith, 'Shurayh"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,foxier than the fox.' When the Sultan heard Badr al-Din Hasan's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"explanation he said to his uncle, Shams al-Din, Truly this the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,son of thy brother is perfect in courtly breeding and I do not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,think that his like can be found in Cairo. At this Hasan arose
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and kissed the ground before him and sat down again as a Mameluke
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,should sit before his master. When the Sultan had thus assured
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,himself of his courtly breeding and bearing and his knowledge of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the liberal arts and belles-lettres, he joyed with exceeding joy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and invested him with a splendid robe of honour and promoted him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to an office whereby he might better his condition. [FN#492]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then Badr al-Din Hasan arose and, kissing the ground before the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King, wished him continuance of glory and asked leave to retire"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with his uncle, the Wazir Shams al-Din. The Sultan gave him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leave and he issued forth and the two returned home, where food"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was set before them and they ate what Allah had given them.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,After finishing his meal Hasan repaired to the sitting-chamber of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his wife, the Lady of Beauty, and told her what had past between"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him and the Sultan; whereupon quoth she, He cannot fail to make"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee a cup-companion and give thee largess in excess and load
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee with favours and bounties; so shalt thou, by Allah's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blessing, dispread, like the greater light, the rays of thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"perfection wherever thou be, on shore or on sea. Said he to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, I purpose to recite a Kasidah, an ode, in his praise, that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he may redouble in affection for me. Thou art right in thine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"intent, she answered, so gather thy wits together and weigh thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"words, and I shall surely see my husband favoured with his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,highest favour. Thereupon Hasan shut himself up and composed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these couplets on a solid base and abounding in inner grace and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,copies them out in a hand-writing of the nicest taste. They are
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,as follows:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Mine is a Chief who reached most haught estate, * Treading the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     pathways of the good and great:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"His justice makes all regions safe and sure, * And against"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     froward foes bars every gate:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bold lion, hero, saint, e'en if you call * Seraph or Sovran"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     [FN#493] he with all may rate!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The poorest supplicant rich from him returns, * All words to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     praise him were inadequate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"He to the day of peace is saffron Morn, * And murky Night in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     furious warfare's bate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bow 'neath his gifts our necks, and by his deeds * As King of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     freeborn [FN#494] souls he 'joys his state:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah increase for us his term of years, * And from his lot avert"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     all risks and fears!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When he had finished transcribing the lines, he despatched them,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in charge of one of his uncle's slaves, to the Sultan, who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perused them and his fancy was pleased; so he read them to those
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,present and all praised them with the highest praise. Thereupon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he sent for the writer to his sitting-chamber and said to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thou art from this day forth my boon-companion and I appoint to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee a monthly solde of a thousand dirhams, over and above that I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bestowed on thee aforetime. So Hasan rose and, kissing the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ground before the King several times, prayed for the continuance"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of his greatness and glory and length of life and strength. Thus
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Badr al-Din Hasan the Bassorite waxed high in honour and his fame
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,flew forth to many regions and he abode in all comfort and solace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and delight of life with his uncle and his own folk till Death
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,overtook him. When the Caliph Harun al-Rashid heard this story
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from the mouth of his Wazir, Ja'afar the Barmecide, he marvelled"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"much and said, It behoves that these stories be written in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,letters of liquid gold. Then he set the slave at liberty and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,assigned to the youth who had slain his wife such a monthly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stipend as sufficed to make his life easy; he also gave him a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,concubine from amongst his own slave-girls and the young man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"became one of his cup-companions. Yet this story, (continued"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Shahrazad) is in no wise stranger than the tale of the Tailor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the Hunchback and the Jew and the Reeve and the Nazarene, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what betided them. Quoth the King, And what may that be? So"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shahrazad began, in these words,[FN#495]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,                     THE HUNCHBACK'S TALE.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there dwelt during"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"times of yore, and years and ages long gone before, in a certain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"city of China,[FN#496] a Tailor who was an open handed man that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loved pleasuring and merry making; and who was wont, he and his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wife, to solace themselves from time to time with public"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,diversions and amusements. One day they went out with the first
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the light and were returning in the evening when they fell in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with a Hunchback, whose semblance would draw a laugh from care"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and dispel the horrors of despair. So they went up to enjoy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,looking at him and invited him to go home with them and converse
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and carouse with them that night. He consented and accompanied
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them afoot to their home; whereupon the Tailor fared forth to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bazaar (night having just set in) and bought a fried fish and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bread and lemons and dry sweetmeats for dessert; and set the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,victuals before the Hunchback and they ate. Presently the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Tailor's wife took a great fid of fish and gave it in a gobbet to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Gobbo, stopping his mouth with her hand and saying, By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, thou must down with it at a single gulp; and I will not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,give thee time to chew it. So he bolted it; but therein was a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stiff bone which stuck in his gullet and, his hour being come, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,died.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Twenty-fifth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Tailor's wife gave the Hunchback that mouthful of fish which
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ended his term of days he died on the instant. Seeing this the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tailor cried aloud, There is no Majesty and there is no Might"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"save in Allah! Alas, that this poor wretch should have died in so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"foolish fashion at our hands! and the woman rejoined, Why this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,idle talk? Hast thou not heard his saying who said:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Why then waste I my time in grief, until I * find no friend to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bear my weight of woe
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,How sleep upon a fire that flames unquenched? * Upon the flames
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     to rest were hard enow!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Asked her husband, And what shall I do with him?; and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, Rise and take him in thine arms and spread a silken"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kerchief over him; then I will fare forth, with thee following me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this very night and if thou meet any one say, 'This is my son,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and his mother and I are carrying him to the doctor that he may
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,look at him.' So he rose and taking the Hunchback in his arms
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bore him along the streets, preceded by his wife who kept crying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my son, Allah keep thee! what part paineth thee and where hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this small-pox[FN#497] attacked thee? So all who saw them said
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Tis a child sick of small-pox. [FN#498] They went along asking
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for the physician's house till folk directed them to that of a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leach which was a Jew. They knocked at the door, and there came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"down to them a black slave girl who opened and, seeing a man"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bearing a babe, and a woman with him, said to them, What is the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"matter? We have a little one with us, answered the Tailor's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wife, and we wish to show him to the physician: so take this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,quarter dinar and give it to thy master and let him come down and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,see my son who is sore sick. The girl went up to tell her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"master, whereupon the Tailor's wife walked into the vestibule and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to her husband, Leave the Hunchback here and let us fly for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,our lives. So the Tailor carried the dead man to the top of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stairs and propped him upright against the wall and ran away, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and his wife. Meanwhile the girl went in to the Jew and said to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, At the door are a man and a woman with a sick child and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they have given me a quarter dinar for thee, that thou mayest go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down and look at the little one and prescribe for it. As soon as
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Jew saw the quarter dinar he rejoiced and rose quickly in his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,greed of gain and went forth hurriedly in the dark; but hardly
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had he made a step when he stumbled on the corpse and threw it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"over, when it rolled to the bottom of the staircase. So he cried"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out to the girl to hurry up with the light, and she brought it,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whereupon he went down and examining the Hunchback found that he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was stone dead. So he cried out, O for Esdras![FN#499] O for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Moses! O for Aaron! O for Joshua, son of Nun! O the Ten"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Commandments! I have stumbled against the sick one and he hath
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fallen downstairs and he is dead! How shall I get this man I have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,killed out of my house? O by the hoofs of the ass of Esdras!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he took up the body and, carrying it into the house, told"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his wife what had happened and she said to him, Why dost thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sit still? If thou keep him here till day break we shall both
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lose our lives. Let us two carry him to the terrace roof and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"throw him over into the house of our neighbour, the Moslem, for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,if he abide there a night the dogs will come down on him from the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,adjoining terraces and eat him up. Now his neighbour was a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Reeve, the controller of the Sultan's kitchen, and was wont to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bring back great store of oil and fat and broken meats; but the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cats and rats used to eat it, or, if the dogs scented a fat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sheep's tail they would come down from the nearest roofs and tear
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at it; and on this wise the beasts had already damaged much of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what he brought home. So the Jew and his wife carried the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hunchback up to the roof; and, letting him down by his hands and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feet through the wind-shaft[FN#500] into the Reeve's house,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,propped him up against the wall and went their ways. Hardly had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they done this when the Reeve, who had been passing an evening"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with his friends hearing a recitation of the Koran, came home and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"opened the door and, going up with a lighted candle, found a son"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of Adam standing in the corner under the ventilator. When he saw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this, he said, Wah! by Allah, very good forsooth! He who robbeth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my stuff is none other than a man. Then he turned to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hunchback and said, So 'tis thou that stealest the meat and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fat! I thought it was the cats and dogs, and I kill the dogs and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cats of the quarter and sin against them by killing them. And all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the while 'tis thou comest down from the house terrace through
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the wind shaft. But I will avenge myself upon thee with my own
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hand! So he snatched up a heavy hammer and set upon him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,smote him full on the breast and he fell down. Then he examined
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him and, finding that he was dead, cried out in horror, thinking"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that he had killed him, and said, There is no Majesty and there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! And he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feared for his life, and added Allah curse the oil and the meat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the grease and the sheep's tails to boot! How hath fate given
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this man his quietus at my hand! Then he looked at the body and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seeing it was that of a Gobbo, said, Was it not enough for thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to be a hunchback,[FN#501] but thou must likewise be a thief and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prig flesh and fat! O thou Veiler,[FN#502] deign to veil me with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thy curtain of concealment! So he took him up on his shoulders
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, going forth with him from his house about the latter end of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the night, carried him to the nearest end of the bazaar, where he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,set him up on his feet against the wall of a shop at the head of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a dark lane, and left him and went away. After a while up came a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nazarene,[FN#503] the Sultan's broker who, much bemused with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"liquor, was purposing for the Hammam bath as his drunkenness"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whispered in his ear, Verily the call to matins[FN#504] is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nigh. He came plodding along and staggering about till he drew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,near the Hunchback and squatted down to make water[FN#505] over
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,against him; when he happened to glance around and saw a man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,standing against the wall. Now some person had snatched off the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Christian's turband[FN#506] in the first of the night; so when he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saw the Hunchback hard by he fancied that he also meant to steal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his headdress. Thereupon he clenched his fist and struck him on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the neck, felling him to the ground, and called aloud to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"watchman of the bazaar, and came down on the body in his drunken"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fury and kept on belabouring and throttling the corpse. Presently
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Charley came up and, finding a Nazarene kneeling on a Moslem"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and frapping him, asked, What harm hath this one done?; and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Broker answered, The fellow meant to snatch off my turband."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Get up from him, quoth the watch man. So he arose and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Charley went up to the Hunchback and finding him dead, exclaimed,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah, good indeed! A Christian killing a Mahometan! Then he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seized the Broker and, tying his hands behind his back, carried"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him to the Governor's house,[FN#507] and all the while the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nazarene kept saying to himself, O Messiah! O Virgin! how came I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to kill this fellow? And in what a hurry he must have been to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"depart this life when he died of a single blow! Presently, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his drunkenness fled, came dolour in its stead. So the Broker and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the body were kept in the Governor's place till morning morrowed,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when the Wali came out and gave order to hang the supposed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,murderer and commanded the executioner[FN#508] make proclamation
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the sentence. Forthwith they set up a gallows under which they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made the Nazarene stand and the torch bearer, who was hangman,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,threw the rope round his neck and passed one end through the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pulley, and was about to hoist him up[FN#509] when lo! the Reeve,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who was passing by, saw the Broker about to be hanged; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"making his way through the people, cried out to the executioner,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hold! Hold! I am he who killed the Hunchback! Asked the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Governor, What made thee kill him?; and he answered, I went"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,home last night and there found this man who had come down the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ventilator to steal my property; so I smote him with a hammer on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the breast and he died forthright. Then I took him up and carried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him to the bazaar and set him up against the wall in such a place
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"near such a lane; adding, Is it not enough for me to have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,killed a Moslem without also killing a Christian? So hang none
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,other but me. When the Governor heard these words he released
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Broker and said to the torch bearer, Hang up this man on his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,own confession. So he loosed the cord from the Nazarene's neck
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and threw it round that of the Reeve and, making him stand under"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the gallows tree, was about to string him up when behold, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Jewish physician pushed through the people and shouted to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"executioner, Hold! Hold! It was I and none else killed the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hunchback! Last night I was sitting at home when a man and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"woman knocked at the door carrying this Gobbo who was sick, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gave my handmaid a quarter dinar, bidding her hand me the fee and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tell me to come down and see him. Whilst she was gone the man and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the woman brought him into the house and, setting him on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stairs, went away; and presently I came down and not seeing him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for I was in the dark, stumbled over him and he fell to the foot"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the staircase and died on the moment. Then we took him up, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and my wife, and carried him on to the top terrace; and, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house of this Reeve being next door to mine, we let the body down"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,through the ventilator. When he came home and found the Hunchback
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in his house, he fancied he was a thief and struck him with a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hammer, so that he fell to the ground, and our neighbour made"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,certain that he had slain him. Now is it not enough for me to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have killed one Moslem unwittingly, without burdening myself with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,taking the life of another Moslem wittingly? When the Governor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard this he said to the hangman, Set free the Reeve and hang"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Jew. Thereupon the torch bearer took him and slung the cord
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"round his neck when behold, the Tailor pushed through the people,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and shouted to the executioner, Hold! Hold! It was I and none"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,else killed the Hunchback; and this was the fashion thereof. I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had been out a pleasuring yesterday and, coming back to supper,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell in with this Gobbo, who was drunk and drumming away and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,singing lustily to his tambourine. So I accosted him and carried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him to my house and bought a fish, and we sat down to eat."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Presently my wife took a fid of fish and, making a gobbet of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it,[FN#510] crammed it into his mouth; but some of it went down"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the wrong way or stuck in his gullet and he died on the instant.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So we lifted him up, I and my wife, and carried him to the Jew's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,house where the slave girl came down and opened the door to us
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I said to her, 'Tell thy master that there are a man and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,woman and a sick person for thee to see!' I gave her a quarter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dinar and she went up to tell her master; and, whilst she was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gone, I carried the Hunchback to the head of the staircase and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"propped him up against the wall, and went off with my wife. When"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Jew came down he stumbled over him and thought that he had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"killed him. Then he asked the Jew, Is this the truth?; and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Jew answered, Yes. Thereupon the Tailor turned to the Governor,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, Leave go the Jew and hang me. When the Governor heard"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Tailor's tale he marvelled at the matter of this Hunchback
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and exclaimed. Verily this is an adventure which should be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"recorded in books! Then he said to the hangman, Let the Jew go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and hang the Tailor on his own confession. The executioner took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Tailor and put the rope around his neck and said, I am tired"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of such slow work: we bring out this one and change him for that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"other, and no one is hanged after all! Now the Hunchback in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"question was, they relate, jester to the Sultan of China who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,could not bear him out of his sight; so when the fellow got drunk
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and did not make his appearance that night or the next day till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"noon, the Sultan asked some of his courtiers about him and they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, O our lord, the Governor hath come upon him dead and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hath ordered his murderer to be hanged; but, as the hangman was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,about to hoist him up there came a second and a third and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fourth and each one said, 'It is I, and none else killed the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hunchback!' and each gave a full and circumstantial account of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the manner of the jester being killed. When the King heard this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he cried aloud to the Chamberlain in waiting, Go down to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Governor and bring me all four of them. So the Chamberlain went
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"down at once to the place of execution, where he found the torch"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bearer on the point of hanging the Tailor and shouted to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hold! Hold! Then he gave the King's command to the Governor who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"took the Tailor, the Jew, the Nazarene and the Reeve (the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hunchback's body being borne on men's shoulders) and went up with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one and all of them to the King. When he came into the presence,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he kissed the ground and acquainted the ruler with the whole
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"story which it is needless to relate for, as they say, There is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,no avail in a thrice told tale. The Sultan hearing it marvelled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and was moved to mirth and commanded the story to be written in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"letters of liquid gold, saying to those present, Did ye ever"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hear a more wondrous tale than that of my Hunchback? Thereupon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Nazarene broker came forward and said, O King of the age,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with thy leave I will tell thee a thing which happened to myself
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and which is still more wondrous and marvellous and pleasurable
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and delectable than the tale of the Hunchback. Quoth the King
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Tell us what thou hast to say! So he began in these words
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Nazarene Broker's Story.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O King of the age, I came to this thy country with merchandise"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and Destiny stayed me here with you: but my place of birth was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Cairo, in Egypt, where I also was brought up, for I am one of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Copts and my father was a broker before me. When I came to man's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,estate he departed this life and I succeeded to his business. One
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"day, as I was sitting in my shop, behold, there came up to me a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"youth as handsome as could be, wearing sumptuous raiment and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"riding a fine ass.[FN#511] When he saw me he saluted me, and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stood up to do him honour: then he took out a kerchief containing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a sample of sesame and asked, How much is this worth per"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Ardabb?;[FN#512] whereto I answered, An hundred dirhams. Quoth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he, Take porters and gaugers and metesmen and come tomorrow to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Khan al-Jawáli,[FN#513] by the Gate of Victory quarter where"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou wilt find me. Then he fared forth leaving with me the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sample of sesame in his kerchief; and I went the round of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,customers and ascertained that every Ardabb would fetch an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hundred and twenty dirhams. Next day I took four metesmen and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"walked with them to the Khan, where I found him awaiting me. As"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"soon as he saw me he rose and opened his magazine, when we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,measured the grain till the store was empty; and we found the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"contents fifty Ardabbs, making five thousand pieces of silver."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then said he, Let ten dirhams on every Ardabb be thy brokerage;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so take the price and keep in deposit four thousand and five
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hundred dirhams for me; and, when I have made an end of selling"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the other wares in my warehouses, I will come to thee and receive"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the amount. I will well, replied I and kissing his hand went"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"away, having made that day a profit of a thousand dirhams. He was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"absent a month, at the end of which he came to me and asked,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Where be the dirhams? I rose and saluted him and answered to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, Wilt thou not eat somewhat in my house? But he refused"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with the remark, Get the monies ready and I will presently"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,return and take them. Then he rode away. So I brought out the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dirhams and sat down to await him, but he stayed away for another"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"month, when he came back and said to me, Where be the dirhams?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I rose and saluting him asked, Wilt thou not eat some thing in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my house? But he again refused adding, Get me the monies ready"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I will presently return and take them. Then he rode off. So
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I brought out the dirhams and sat down to await his return; but
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he stayed away from me a third month, and I said, Verily this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,young man is liberality in incarnate form. At the end of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"month he came up, riding a mare mule and wearing a suit of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sumptuous raiment; he was as the moon on the night of fullness,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he seemed as if fresh from the baths, with his cheeks rosy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bright, and his brow flower white, and a mole spot like a grain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of ambergris delighting the sight; even as was said of such an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one by the poet:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Full moon with sun in single mansion * In brightest sheen and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     fortune rose and shone,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,With happy splendour changing every sprite: * Hail to what
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     guerdons prayer with blissful! boon!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Their charms and grace have gained perfection's height, * All"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     hearts have conquered and all wits have won.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Laud to the Lord for works so wonder strange, * And what th'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Almighty wills His hand hath done!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I saw him I rose to him and invoking blessings on him asked,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my lord, wilt thou not take thy monies? Whence the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hurry?[FN#514] quoth he, Wait till I have made an end of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,business and then I will come and take them. Again he rode away
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and I said to myself, By Allah, when he comes next time needs"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,must I make him my guest; for I have traded with his dirhams and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have gotten large gains thereby. At the end of the year he came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again, habited in a suit of clothes more sumptuous than the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"former; and, when I conjured him by the Evangel to alight at my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house and eat of my guest food, he said, I consent, on condition"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that what thou expendest on me shall be of my monies still in thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hands. I answered, So be it, and made him sit down whilst I got"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ready what was needful of meat and drink and else besides; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"set the tray before him, with the invitation Bismillah![FN#515]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he drew near the tray and put out his left hand[FN#516] and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ate with me; and I marvelled at his not using the right hand.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When we had done eating, I poured water on his hand and gave him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wherewith to wipe it. Upon this we sat down to converse after I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had set before him some sweetmeats; and I said to him, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"master, prithee relieve me by telling me why thou eatest with thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,left hand? Perchance something aileth thy other hand? When he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard my words, he repeated these verses:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Dear friend, ask not what burneth in my breast, * Lest thou see"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     fiery pangs eye never saw:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wills not my heart to harbour Salma in stead * Of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     Layla's[FN#517] love, but need hath ne'er a law!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And he put out his right arm from his sleeve and behold, the hand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was cut off, a wrist without a fist. I was astounded at this but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he said, Marvel not, and think not that I ate with my left hand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for conceit and insolence, but from necessity; and the cutting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,off my right hand was caused by an adventure of the strangest.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Asked I, And what caused it?; and he answered:--Know that I am"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the sons of Baghdad and my father was of notables of that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,city. When I came to man's estate I heard the pilgrims and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wayfarers, travellers and merchants talk of the land of Egypt and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their words sank deep into my mind till my parent died, when I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took a large sum of money and furnished myself for trade with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stuffs of Baghdad and Mosul and, packing them up in bales, set"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out on my wanderings; and Allah decreed me safety till I entered
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this your city. Then he wept and began repeating:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy, The blear eyed 'scapes the pits    * Wherein the lynx eyed fall:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy, A word the wise man slays          * And saves the natural:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy, The Moslem fails of food           * The Kafir feasts in hall:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy, What art or act is man's?          * God's will obligeth all!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now when he had ended his verse he said, So I entered Cairo and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took off my loads and stored my stuffs in the Khan Al-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Masrúr.[FN#518] Then I gave the servant a few silvers wherewith
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to buy me some food and lay down to sleep awhile. When I awoke I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went to the street called Bayn al-Kasrayn--Between the two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Palaces--and presently returned and rested my night in the Khan.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When it was morning I opened a bale and took out some stuff
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying to myself, I will be off and go through some of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bazaars and see the state of the market. So I loaded the stuff
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on some of my slaves and fared forth till I reached the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Kaysariyah or Exchange of Jaharkas;[FN#519] where the brokers who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,knew of my coming came to meet me. They took the stuffs and cried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them for sale, but could not get the prime cost of them. I was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"vexed at this, however the Shaykh of the brokers said to me, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my lord, I will tell thee how thou mayest make a profit of thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,goods. Thou shouldest do as the merchants do and sell thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchandise at credit for a fixed period, on a contract drawn up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,by a notary and duly witnessed; and employ a Shroff to take thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dues every Monday and Thursday. So shalt thou gain two dirhams
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and more, for every one; and thou shalt solace and divert thyself"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"by seeing Cairo and the Nile. Quoth I, This is sound advice,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and carried the brokers to the Khan. They took my stuffs and went
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with them on 'Change where I sold them well taking bonds for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"value. These bonds I deposited with a Shroff, a banker, who gave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me a receipt with which I returned to the Khan. Here I stayed a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whole month, every morning breaking my fast with a cup of wine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and making my meals on pigeon's meat, mutton and sweetmeats, till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the time came when my receipts began to fall due. So, every"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Monday and Thursday I used to go on 'Change and sit in the shop
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of one or other of the merchants, whilst the notary and money"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"changer went round to recover the monies from the traders, till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after the time of mid afternoon prayer, when they brought me the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"amount, and I counted it and, sealing the bags, returned with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them to the Khan. On a certain day which happened to be a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Monday,[FN#520] I went to the Hammam and thence back to my Khan,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and sitting in my own room[FN#521] broke my fast with a cup of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wine, after which I slept a little. When I awoke I ate a chicken"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, perfuming my person, repaired to the shop of a merchant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hight Badr al-Din al-Bostáni, or the Gardener,[FN#522] who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,welcomed me; and we sat talking awhile till the bazaar should
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"open. Presently, behold, up came a lady of stately figure wearing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a head-dress of the most magnificent, perfumed with the sweetest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of scents and walking with graceful swaying gait; and seeing me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she raised her mantilla allowing me a glimpse of her beautiful
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,black eyes. She saluted Badr al-Din who returned her salutation
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and stood up, and talked with her; and the moment I heard her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"speak, the love of her got hold of my heart. Presently she said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to Badr al-Din, Hast thou by thee a cut piece of stuff woven"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with thread of pure gold? So he brought out to her a piece from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,those he had bought of me and sold it to her for one thousand two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hundred dirhams; when she said, I will take the piece home with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me and send thee its price. That is impossible, O my lady, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchant replied, for here is the owner of the stuff and I owe"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him a share of profit. Fie upon thee! she cried, Do I not use"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to take from thee entire rolls of costly stuff, and give thee a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"greater profit than thou expectest, and send thee the money?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Yes, rejoined he; but I stand in pressing need of the price"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this very day. Hereupon she took up the piece and threw it back
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon his lap, saying Out on thee! Allah confound the tribe of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,you which estimates none at the right value; and she turned to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,go. I felt my very soul going with her; so I stood up and stayed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, saying, I conjure thee by the Lord, O my lady, favour me by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,retracing thy gracious steps. She turned back with a smile and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, For thy sake I return, and took a seat opposite me in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shop. Then quoth I to Badr al-Din, What is the price they asked"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee for this piece?; and quoth he, Eleven hundred dirhams. I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoined, The odd hundred shall be thy profit: bring me a sheet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of paper and I will write thee a discharge for it. Then I wrote
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him a receipt in my own handwriting and gave the piece to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady, saying, Take it away with thee and, if thou wilt, bring me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"its price next bazaar day; or better still, accept it as my guest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gift to thee. Allah requite thee with good, answered she, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,make thee my husband and lord and master of all I have![FN#523]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And Allah favoured her prayer. I saw the Gates of Paradise swing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"open before me and said, O my lady, let this piece of stuff be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"now thine and another like it is ready for thee, only let me have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one look at thy face. So she raised her veil and I saw a face
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the sight of which bequeathed to me a thousand sighs, and my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heart was so captivated by her love that I was no longer ruler of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my reason. Then she let fall her face veil and taking up the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"piece of stuff said, O my lord make me not desolate by thine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,absence! and turned away and disappeared from my sight. I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,remained sitting on 'Change till past the hour of after noon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prayer, lost to the world by the love which had mastered me, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the violence of my passion compelled me to make enquiries
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"concerning her of the merchant, who answered me, This is a lady"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and a rich: she is the daughter of a certain Emir who lately died
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and left her a large fortune. Then I took leave of him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,returned home to the Khan where they set supper before me; but I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"could not eat for thinking of her and when I lay down to sleep,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sleep came not near me. So I watched till morning, when I arose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and donned a change of raiment and drank a cup of wine and, after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"breaking my fast on some slight matter, I went to the merchant's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shop where I saluted him and sat down by him. Presently up came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the lady as usual, followed by a slave girl and wearing a dress"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,more sumptuous than before; and she saluted me without noticing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Badr al-Din and said in fluent graceful speech (never heard I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"voice softer or sweeter), Send one with me to take the thousand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and two hundred dirhams, the price of the piece. Why this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hurry? asked I and she answered, May we never lose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee![FN#524] and handed me the money. Then I sat talking with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her and presently I signed to her in dumb show, whereby she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"understood that I longed to enjoy her person,[FN#525] and she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rose up in haste with a show of displeasure. My heart clung to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her and I went forth from the bazaar and followed on her track.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"As I was walking suddenly a black slave girl stopped me and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my master, come speak with my mistress.[FN#526] At this I was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"surprised and replied, There is none who knows me here; but she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoined, 0 my lord, how soon hast thou forgotten her! My lady"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is the same who was this day at the shop of such a merchant.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then I went with her to the Shroff's, where I found the lady who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"drew me to her side and said, O my beloved, thine image is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"firmly stamped upon my fancy, and love of thee hath gotten hold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of my heart: from the hour I first saw thee nor sleep nor food
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nor drink hath given me aught of pleasure. I replied, The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,double of that suffering is mine and my state dispenseth me from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"complaint. Then said she, O my beloved, at thy house, or at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mine? I am a stranger here and have no place of reception save
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Khan, so by thy favour it shall be at thy house. So be it;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but this is Friday[FN#527] night and nothing can be done till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tomorrow after public prayers; go to the Mosque and pray; then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mount thine ass, and ask for the Habbániyah[FN#528] quarter; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when there, look out for the mansion of Al-Nakib[FN#529] Barakát,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,popularly known as Abu Shámah the Syndic; for I live there: so do
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not delay as I shall be expecting thee. I rejoiced with still
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,greater joy at this; and took leave of her and returned to my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Khan, where I passed a sleepless night. Hardly was I assured that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"morning had dawned when I rose, changed my dress, perfumed myself"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with essences and sweet scents and, taking fifty dinars in a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kerchief, went from the Khan Masrúr to the Zuwaylah[FN#530] gate,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"where I mounted an ass and said to its owner, Take me to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Habbaniyah. So he set off with me and brought up in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"twinkling of an eye at a street known as Darb al-Munkari, where I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to him, Go in and ask for the Syndic's mansion. He was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"absent a while and then returned and said, Alight. Go thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before me to the house, quoth I, adding, Come back with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"earliest light and bring me home; and he answered, In Allah's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"name; whereupon I gave him a quarter dinar of gold, and he took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it and went his ways. Then I knocked at the door and out came two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"white slave girls, both young; high-bosomed virgins, as they were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"moons, and said to me, Enter, for our mistress is expecting thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and she hath not slept the night long for her delight in thee. I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"passed through the vestibule into a saloon with seven doors,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,floored with parti-coloured marbles and furnished with curtains
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and hangings of coloured silks: the ceiling was cloisonné with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gold and corniced with inscriptions[FN#531] emblazoned in lapis
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lazuli; and the walls were stuccoed with Sultání gypsum[FN#532]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which mirrored the beholder's face. Around the saloon were
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,latticed windows overlooking a garden full of all manner of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fruits; whose streams were railing and riffling and whose birds
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,were trilling and shrilling; and in the heart of the hall was a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,jetting fountain at whose corners stood birds fashioned in red
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gold crusted with pearls and gems and spouting water crystal
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,clear. When I entered and took a seat.--And Shahrazad perceived
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Twenty-sixth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchant continued, When I entered and took a seat, the lady at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,once came in crowned with a diadem[FN#533] of pearls and jewels;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her face dotted with artificial moles in indigo,[FN#534] her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eyebrows pencilled with Kohl and her hands and feet reddened with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Henna. When she saw me she smiled in my face and took me to her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,embrace and clasped me to her breast; then she put her mouth to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my mouth and sucked my tongue[FN#535] (and I did likewise) and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, Can it be true, O my little darkling, thou art come to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me? adding, Welcome and good cheer to thee! By Allah, from the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,day I saw thee sleep hath not been sweet to me nor hath food been
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pleasant. Quoth I, Such hath also been my case: and I am thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slave, thy negro slave. Then we sat down to converse and I hung"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my head earthwards in bashfulness, but she delayed not long ere"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she set before me a tray of the most exquisite viands, marinated"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"meats, fritters soaked in bee's[FN#536] honeys and chickens"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stuffed with sugar and pistachio nuts, whereof we ate till we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,were satisfied. Then they brought basin and ewer and I washed my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hands and we scented ourselves with rose water musk'd and sat
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,down again to converse. So she began repeating these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,couplets[FN#537]:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Had we wist of thy coming, thy way had been strewn"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,       With the blood of our heart and the balls of our sight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Our cheek as a foot cloth to greet thee been thrown,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,       That thy step on our eyelids should softly alight.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And she kept plaining of what had befallen her and I of what had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,betided me; and love of her got so firm hold of my heart that all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my wealth seemed a thing of naught in comparison with her. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"we fell to toying and groping and kissing till night fall, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the handmaidens set before us meats and a complete wine service,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and we sat carousing till the noon of night, when we lay down and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I lay with her; never in my life saw I a night like that night.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When morning morrowed I arose and took leave of her, throwing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,under the carpet bed the kerchief wherein were the dinars[FN#538]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and as I went out she wept and said, O my lord, when shall I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,look upon that lovely face again? I will be with thee at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sunset, answered I, and going out found the donkey boy, who had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brought me the day before, awaiting at the door. So I mounted ass"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and rode to the Khan of Masrur where I alighted and gave the man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"a half dinar, saying, Return at sunset; and he said I will."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then I breakfasted and went out to seek the price of my stuffs;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after which I returned, and taking a roast lamb and some"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sweetmeats, called a porter and put the provision in his crate,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and sent it to the lady paying the man his hire.[FN#539] I went
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"back to my business till sunset, when the ass driver came to me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I took fifty dinars in a kerchief and rode to her house where
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I found the marble floor swept, the brasses burnisht, the branch"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lights burning, the wax candles ready lighted, the meat served up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the wine strained.[FN#540] When my lady saw me she threw her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arms about my neck, and cried, Thou hast desolated me by thine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,absence. Then she set the tables before me and we ate till we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"were satisfied, when the slave girls carried off the trays and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,served up wine. We gave not over drinking till half the night was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"past; and, being well warmed with drink, we went to the sleeping"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chamber and lay there till morning. I then arose and fared forth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from her leaving the fifty dinars with her as before; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"finding the donkey boy at the door, rode to the Khan and slept"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,awhile. After that I went out to make ready the evening meal and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took a brace of geese with gravy on two platters of dressed and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"peppered rice, and got ready colocasia[FN#541]-roots fried and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"soaked in honey, and wax candles and fruits and conserves and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nuts and almonds and sweet scented cowers; and I sent them all to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her. As soon as it was night I again tied up fifty dinars in a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kerchief and, mounting the ass as usual, rode to the mansion"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where we ate and drank and lay together till morning when I threw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the kerchief and dinars to her[FN#542] and rode back to the Khan.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I ceased not doing after that fashion till, after a sweet night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I woke one fine morning and found myself beggared, dinar-less and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dirhamless. So said I to myself All this be Satan's work; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,began to recite these couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Poverty dims the sheen of man whate'er his wealth has been, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     E'en as the sun about to set shines with a yellowing light
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Absent he falls from memory, forgotten by his friends; * Present"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     he shareth not their joys for none in him delight
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"He walks the market shunned of all, too glad to hide his head, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     In desert places tears he sheds and moans his bitter plight
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah, 'mid his kith and kin a man, however good, * Waylaid"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     by want and penury is but a stranger wight!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I fared forth from the Khan and walked down Between the Palaces
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"street till I came to the Zuwaylah Porte, where I found the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,people crowding and the gateway blocked for the much folk. And by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the decree of Destiny I saw there a trooper against whom I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pressed unintentionally, so that my hand came upon his bosom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pocket and I felt a purse inside it. I looked and seeing a string
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of green silk hanging from the pocket knew it for a purse; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the crush grew greater every minute and just then, a camel laden"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with a load of fuel happened to jostle the trooper on the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"opposite side, and he turned round to fend it off from him, lest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it tear his clothes; and Satan tempted me, so I pulled the string"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and drew out a little bag of blue silk, containing something"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which chinked like coin. But the soldier, feeling his pocket"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"suddenly lightened, put his hand to it and found it empty;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereupon he turned to me and, snatching up his mace from his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saddle bow, struck me with it on the head. I fell to the ground,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whilst the people came round us and seizing the trooper's mare by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the bridle said to him, Strikest thou this youth such a blow as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this for a mere push! But the trooper cried out at them, This"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fellow is an accursed thief! Whereupon I came to myself and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stood up, and the people looked at me and said, Nay, he is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,comely youth: he would not steal anything; and some of them took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my part and others were against me and question and answer waxed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,loud and warm. The people pulled at me and would have rescued me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from his clutches; but as fate decreed behold, the Governor, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Chief of Police, and the watch[FN#543] entered the Zuwaylah Gate"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at this moment and, seeing the people gathered together around me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the soldier, the Governor asked, What is the matter? By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah! O Emir, answered the trooper, this is a thief! I had in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my pocket a purse of blue silk lined with twenty good gold pieces
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he took it, whilst I was in the crush. Quoth the Governor,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Was any one by thee at the time?; and quoth the soldier, No."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thereupon the Governor cried out to the Chief of Police who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seized me, and on this wise the curtain of the Lord's. protection"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was withdrawn from me. Then he said Strip him; and, when they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stripped me, they found the purse in my clothes. The Wali took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it, opened it and counted it; and, finding in it twenty dinars as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the soldier had said, waxed exceeding wroth and bade his guard"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bring me before him. Then said he to me, Now, O youth, speak"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,truly: didst thou steal this purse?[FN#544] At this I hung my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"head to the ground and said to myself, If I deny having stolen"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it, I shall get myself into terrible trouble. So I raised my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"head and said, Yes, I took it. When the Governor heard these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,words he wondered and summoned witnesses who came forward and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,attested my confession. All this happened at the Zuwaylah Gate.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then the Governor ordered the link bearer to cut off my right
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hand, and he did so; after which he would have struck off my left"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,foot also; but the heart of the soldier softened and he took pity
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on me and interceded for me with the Governor that I should not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be slain.[FN#545] Thereupon the Wali left me, and went away and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the folk remained round me and gave me a cup of wine to drink. As
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for the trooper he pressed the purse upon me, and said, Thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a comely youth and it befitteth not thou be a thief. So I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,repeated these verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I swear by Allah's name, fair sir! no thief was I, * Nor, O thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     best of men! was I a bandit bred:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But Fortune's change and chance o'erthrew me suddenly, * And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     cark and care and penury my course misled:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I shot it not, indeed, 'twas Allah shot the shaft * That rolled"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     in dust the Kingly diadem from my head.[FN#546]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The soldier turned away after giving me the purse; and I also
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went my ways having wrapped my hand in a piece of rag and thrust
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it into my bosom. My whole semblance had changed, and my colour"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had waxed yellow from the shame and pain which had befallen me.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Yet I went on to my mistress's house where, in extreme"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perturbation of spirit I threw myself down on the carpet bed. She
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw me in this state and asked me, What aileth thee and why do I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"see thee so changed in looks?; and I answered, My head paineth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me and I am far from well. Whereupon she was vexed and was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"concerned on my account and said, Burn not my heart, O my lord,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but sit up and raise thy head and recount to me what hath
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"happened to thee today, for thy face tells me a tale. Leave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this talk, replied I. But she wept and said, Me seems thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tired of me, for I see thee contrary to thy wont. But I was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,silent; and she kept on talking to me albeit I gave her no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answer, till night came on. Then she set food before me, but I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,refused it fearing lest she see me eating with my left hand and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to her, I have no stomach to eat at present. Quoth she,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tell me what hath befallen thee to day, and why art thou so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sorrowful and broken in spirit and heart? Quoth I, Wait awhile;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I will tell thee all at my leisure. Then she brought me wine,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, Down with it, this will dispel thy grief: thou must"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"indeed drink and tell me of thy tidings. I asked her, Perforce"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"must I tell thee?; and she answered, Yes. Then said I, If it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"needs must be so, then give me to drink with thine own hand. She"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"filled and drank,[FN#547] and filled again and gave me the cup"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which I took from her with my left hand and wiped the tears from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my eyelids and began repeating:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When Allah willeth aught befall a man * Who hath of ears and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     eyes and wits full share:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,His ears He deafens and his eyes He blinds * And draws his wits
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     e'en as we draw a hair[FN#548]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Till, having wrought His purpose, He restores * Man's wits, that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     warned more circumspect he fare.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When I ended my verses I wept, and she cried out with an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding loud cry, What is the cause of thy tears? Thou burnest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my heart! What makes thee take the cup with thy left hand? Quoth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I, Truly I have on my right hand a boil; and quoth she, Put it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out and I will open it for thee.[FN#549] It is not yet time to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"open it, I replied, so worry me not with thy words, for I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not take it out of the bandage at this hour. Then I drank off
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the cup, and she gave not over plying me with drink until"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,drunkenness overcame me and I fell asleep in the place where I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was sitting; whereupon she looked at my right hand and saw a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wrist without a fist. So she searched me closely and found with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me the purse of gold and my severed hand wrapped up in the bit of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rag.[FN#550] With this such sorrow came upon her as never
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,overcame any and she ceased not lamenting on my account till the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,morning. When I awoke I found that she had dressed me a dish of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"broth of four boiled chickens, which she brought to me together"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with a cup of wine. I ate and drank and laying down the purse,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"would have gone out; but she said to me, Whither away?; and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, Where my business calleth me; and said she, Thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shalt not go: sit thee down. So I sat down and she resumed,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hath thy love for me so overpowered thee that thou hast wasted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all thy wealth and hast lost thine hand on my account? I take
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee to witness against me and also Allah be my witness that I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will never part with thee, but will die under thy feet; and soon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou shalt see that my words are true. Then she sent for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Kazi and witnesses and said to them, Write my contract of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marriage with this young man, and bear ye witness that I have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,received the marriage settlement.[FN#551] When they had drawn up
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the document she said, Be witness that all my monies which are"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in this chest and all I have in slaves and handmaidens and other
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,property is given in free gift to this young man. So they took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,act of this statement enabling me to assume possession in right
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of marriage; and then withdrew, after receiving their fees."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thereupon she took me by the hand and, leading me to a closet,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"opened a large chest and said to me, See what is herein; and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"looked and behold, it was full of kerchiefs. Quoth she, This is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the money I had from thee and every kerchief thou gavest me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"containing fifty dinars, I wrapped up and cast into this chest;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so now take thine own, for it returns to thee, and this day thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,art become of high estate. Fortune and Fate afflicted thee so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that thou didst lose thy right hand for my sake; and I can never
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"requite thee; nay, although I gave my life 'twere but little and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I should still remain thy debtor. Then she added, Take charge"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of thy property.; so I transferred the contents of her chest to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my chest, and added my wealth to her wealth which I had given"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, and my heart was eased and my sorrow ceased. I stood up and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kissed her and thanked her; and she said, Thou hast given thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hand for love of me and how am I able to give thee an equivalent?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah, if I offered my life for thy love, it were indeed but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,little and would not do justice to thy claim upon me. Then she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made over to me by deed all that she possessed in clothes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ornaments of gold and pearls, and goods and farms and chattels,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and lay not down to sleep that night, being sorely grieved for my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grief, till I told her the whole of what had befallen me. I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,passed the night with her. But before we had lived together a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"month's time she fell sorely sick and illness increased upon her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"by reason of her grief for the loss of my hand, and she endured"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but fifty days before she was numbered among the folk of futurity
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and heirs of immortality. So I laid her out and buried her body
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in mother earth and let make a pious perfection of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Koran[FN#552] for the health of her soul, and gave much money in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,alms for her; after which I turned me from the grave and returned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to the house. There I found that she had left much substance in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ready money and slaves, mansions, lands and domains, and among"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her store houses was a granary of sesame seed, whereof I sold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,part to thee; and I had neither time nor inclination to take
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,count with thee till I had sold the rest of the stock in store;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nor, indeed, even now have I made an end of receiving the price."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So I desire thou baulk me not in what I am about to say to thee:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,twice have I eaten of thy food and I wish to give thee as a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,present the monies for the sesame which are by thee. Such is the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cause of the cutting off my right hand and my eating with my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"left. Indeed, said I, thou hast shown me the utmost kindness"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and liberality. Then he asked me, Why shouldst thou not travel"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with me to my native country whither I am about to return with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Cairene and Alexandrian stuffs? Say me, wilt thou accompany me?;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I answered I will. So I agreed to go with him at the head
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the month, and I sold all I had and bought other merchandise;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"then we set out and travelled, I and the young man, to this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"country of yours, where he sold his venture and bought other"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,investment of country stuffs and continued his journey to Egypt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But it was my lot to abide here, so that these things befell me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in my strangerhood which befell last night, and is not this tale,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O King of the age, more wondrous and marvellous than the story of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Hunchback? Not so, quoth the King, I cannot accept it:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there is no help for it but that you be hanged, every one of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"you.--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"             When it was the Twenty-seventh Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,King of China declared There is no help for it but that you be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hanged, the Reeve of the Sultan's Kitchen came forward and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,If thou permit me I will tell thee a tale of what befell me just
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before I found this Gobbo, and, if it be more wondrous than his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"story, do thou grant us our lives. And when the King answered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Yes he began to recount
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Reeve's Tale.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O King, that last night I was at a party where they made a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perfection of the Koran and got together doctors of law and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"religion skilled in recitation and intoning; and, when the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"readers ended, the table was spread and amongst other things they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,set before us was a marinated ragout[FN#553] flavoured with cumin
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seed. So we sat down, but one of our number held back and refused"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to touch it. We conjured him to eat of it but he swore he would
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not; and, when we again pressed him, he said, Be not instant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with me; sufficeth me that which hath already befallen me through
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eating it, and he began reciting:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shoulder thy tray and go straight to thy goal; * And, if suit"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     thee this Kohl why,-use this Kohl![FN#554]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When he ended his verse we said to him, Allah upon thee, tell us"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy reason for refusing to eat of the cumin ragout? `'If so it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be, he replied, and needs must I eat of it, I will not do so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"except I wash my hand forty times with soap, forty times with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"potash and forty times with galangale,[FN#555] the total being"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one hundred and twenty washings. Thereupon the hospitable host
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bade his slaves bring water and whatso he required; and the young
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man washed his hand as afore mentioned. Then he sat down, as if"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"disgusted and frightened withal, and dipping his hand in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ragout, began eating and at the same time showing signs of anger."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And we wondered at him with extreme wonderment, for his hand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,trembled and the morsel in it shook and we saw that his thumb had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,been cut off and he ate with his four fingers only. So we said to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, Allah upon thee, what happened to thy thumb? Is thy hand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thus by the creation of God or hath some accident befallen it?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my brothers, he answered, it is not only thus with this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thumb, but also with my other thumb and with both my great toes,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,as you shall see. So saying he uncovered his left hand and his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feet, and we saw that the left hand was even as the right and in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,like manner that each of his feet lacked its great toe. When we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saw him after this fashion, our amazement waxed still greater and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"we said to him, We have hardly patience enough to await thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"history and to hear the manner of the cutting off of thy thumbs,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the reason of thy washing both hands one hundred and twenty
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"times. Know then, said he, that my father was chief of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,merchants and the wealthiest of them all in Baghdad city during
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the reign of the Caliph Harun al Rashid; and he was much given to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wine drinking and listening to the lute and the other instruments
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of pleasaunce; so that when he died he left nothing. I buried him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and had perlections of the Koran made for him, and mourned for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him days and nights: then I opened his shop and found that he had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"left in it few goods, while his debts were many. However I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,compounded with his creditors for time to settle their demands
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and betook myself to buying and selling, paying them something"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from week to week on account; and I gave not over doing this till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I had cleared off his obligations in full and began adding to my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"principal. One day, as I sat in my shop, suddenly and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unexpectedly there appeared before me a young lady, than whom I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"never saw a fairer, wearing the richest raiment and ornaments and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"riding a she mule, with one negro slave walking before her and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,another behind her. She drew rein at the head of the exchange
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bazaar and entered followed by an eunuch who said to her, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lady come out and away without telling anyone, lest thou light a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fire which will burn us all up. Moreover he stood before her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,guarding her from view whilst she looked at the merchants' shops.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,She found none open but mine; so she came up with the eunuch
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,behind her and sitting down in my shop saluted me; never heard I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,aught fairer than her speech or sweeter than her voice. Then she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unveiled her face, and I saw that she was like the moon and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stole a glance at her whose sight caused me a thousand sighs, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my heart was captivated with love of her, and I kept looking"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,again and again upon her face repeating these verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Say to the charmer in the dove hued veil, * Death would be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     welcome to abate thy bale!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Favour me with thy favours that I live: * See, I stretch forth my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     palm to take thy vail!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When she heard my verse she answered me saying:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I've lost all patience by despite of you; * My heart knows
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     nothing save love plight to you!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,If aught I sight save charms so bright of you; * My parting end
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     not in the sight of you!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I swear I'll ne'er forget the right of you; * And fain this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     breast would soar to height of you:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"You made me drain the love cup, and I lief * A love cup tender"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     for delight of you:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Take this my form where'er you go, and when * You die, entomb"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     me in the site of you:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Call on me in my grave, and hear my bones * Sigh their responses"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     to the shright of you:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And were I asked 'Of God what wouldst thou see?' * I answer,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     'first His will then Thy decree!'
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When she ended her verse she asked me, O youth, hast thou any"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fair stuffs by thee?; and I answered, O my lady, thy slave is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"poor; but have patience till the merchants open their shops, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I will suit thee with what thou wilt. Then we sat talking, I and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she (and I was drowned in the sea of her love, dazed in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"desert[FN#556] of my passion for her), till the merchants opened"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their shops; when I rose and fetched her all she sought to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tune of five thousand dirhams. She gave the stuff to the eunuch
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, going forth by the door of the Exchange, she mounted mule"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and went away, without telling me whence she came, and I was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ashamed to speak of such trifle. When the merchants dunned me for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the price, I made myself answerable for five thousand dirhams and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went home, drunken with the love of her. They set supper before"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me and I ate a mouthful, thinking only of her beauty and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loveliness, and sought to sleep, but sleep came not to me. And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"such was my condition for a whole week, when the merchants"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"required their monies of me, but I persuaded them to have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"patience for another week, at the end of which time she again"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,appeared mounted on a she mule and attended by her eunuch and two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slaves. She saluted me and said, O my master, we have been long"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in bringing thee the price of the stuffs; but now fetch the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Shroff and take thy monies. So I sent for the money changer and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the eunuch counted out the coin before him and made it over to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me. Then we sat talking, I and she, till the market opened, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she said to me, Get me this and that. So I got her from the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchants whatso she wanted, and she took it and went away"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,without saying a word to me about the price. As soon as she was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out of sight, I repented me of what I had done; for the worth of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the stuffs bought for her amounted to a thousand dinars, and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said in my soul, What manner of love is this? She hath brought"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me five thousand dirhams, and hath taken goods for a thousand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dinars.[FN#557] I feared lest I should be beggared through
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"having to pay the merchants their money, and I said, They know"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,none other but me; this lovely lady is naught but a cheat and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"swindler, who hath diddled me with her beauty and grace; for she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saw that I was a mere youth and laughed at me for not asking her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"address. I ceased not to be troubled by these doubts and fears,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as she was absent more than a month, till the merchants pestered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me for their money and were so hard upon me that I put up my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"property for sale and stood on the very brink of ruin. However,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as I was sitting in my shop one day, drowned in melancholy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"musings, she suddenly rode up and, dismounting at the bazaar"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gate, came straight towards me. When I saw her all my cares fell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from me and I forgot every trouble. She came close up to me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,greeted me with her sweet voice and pleasant speech and presently
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, Fetch me the Shroff and weigh thy money.[FN#558] So she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gave me the price of what goods I had gotten for her and more,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and fell to talking freely with me, till I was like to die of joy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and delight. Presently she asked me, Hast thou a wife?; and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered No, indeed: I have never known woman; and began to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shed tears. Quoth she Why weepest thou? Quoth I It is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nothing! Then giving the eunuch some of the gold pieces, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,begged him to be go between[FN#559] in the matter; but he laughed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, She is more in love with thee than thou with her: she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hath no occasion for the stuffs she hath bought of thee and did
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,all this only for the love of thee; so ask of her what thou wilt
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and she will deny thee nothing. When she saw me giving the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dinars to the eunuch, she returned and sat down again; and I said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to her, Be charitable to thy slave and pardon him what he is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,about to say. Then I told her what was in my mind and she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"assented and said to the eunuch, Thou shalt carry my message to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, adding to me, And do thou whatso the eunuch biddeth thee."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then she got up and went away, and I paid the merchants their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"monies and they all profited; but as for me, regret at the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,breaking off of our intercourse was all my gain; and I slept not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the whole of that night. However, before many days passed her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eunuch came to me, and I entreated him honourably and asked him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after his mistress. Truly she is sick with love of thee, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied and I rejoined, Tell me who and what she is. Quoth he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Lady Zubaydah, queen consort of Harun al-Rashid, brought her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,up as a rearling[FN#560] and hath advanced her to be stewardess
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the Harim, and gave her the right of going in and out of her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,own sweet will. She spoke to her lady of thee and begged her to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"marry her to thee; but she said, 'I will not do this, till I see"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the young man; and, if he be worthy of thee, I will marry thee to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him.' So now we look for the moment to smuggle thee into the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Palace and if thou succeed in entering privily thou wilt win thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wish to wed her; but if the affair get wind, the Lady Zubaydah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will strike off thy head.[FN#561] What sayest thou to this? I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, I will go with thee and abide the risk whereof thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"speakest. Then said he, As soon as it is night, go to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Mosque built by the Lady Zubaydah on the Tigris and pray the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night prayers and sleep there. With love and gladness, cried"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I. So at nightfall I repaired to the Mosque, where I prayed and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"passed the night. With earliest dawn, behold, came sundry eunuchs"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in a skiff with a number of empty chests which they deposited in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Mosque; then all of them went their ways but one, and looking"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"curiously at him, I saw he was our go between. Presently in came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the handmaiden, my mistress, walking straight up to us; and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rose to her and embraced her while she kissed me and shed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tears.[FN#562] We talked awhile; after which she made me get into
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one of the chests which she locked upon me. Presently the other
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eunuchs came back with a quantity of packages and she fell to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stowing them in the chests, which she locked down, one by one,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till all were shut. When all was done the eunuchs embarked the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chests in the boat and made for the Lady Zubaydah's palace. With
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this, thought began to beset me and I said to myself, Verily thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lust and wantonness will be the death of thee; and the question
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is after all shalt thou win to thy wish or not? And I began to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"weep, boxed up as I was in the box and suffering from cramp; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I prayed Allah that He deliver me from the dangerous strait I was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in, whilst the boat gave not over going on till it reached the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Palace gate where they lifted out the chests and amongst them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that in which I was. Then they carried them in, passing through a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"troop of eunuchs, guardians of the Harim and of the ladies behind"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the curtain, till they came to the post of the Eunuch in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Chief[FN#563] who started up from his slumbers and shouted to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,damsel What is in those chests? They are full of wares for the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Lady Zubaydah! Open them, one by one, that I may see what is in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them. And wherefore wouldst thou open them? Give me no words
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and exceed not in talk! These chests must and shall be opened.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So saying, he sprang to his feet, and the first which they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brought to him to open was that wherein I was; and, when I felt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his hands upon it, my senses failed me and I bepissed myself in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my funk, the water running out of the box. Then said she to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Eunuch in Chief, O steward! thou wilt cause me to be killed and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thyself too, for thou hast damaged goods worth ten thousand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dinars. This chest contains coloured dresses, and four gallon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,flasks of Zemzem water;[FN#564] and now one of them hath got
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,unstoppered and the water is running out over the clothes and it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will spoil their colours. The eunuch answered, Take up thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,boxes and get thee gone to the curse of God! So the slaves
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carried off all the chests, including mine; and hastened on with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them till suddenly I heard the voice of one saying, Alack, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,alack! the Caliph! the Caliph ! When that cry struck mine ears I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,died in my skin and said a saying which never yet shamed the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sayer, There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Glorious, the Great! I and only I have brought this calamity"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon myself. Presently I heard the Caliph say to my mistress, A"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"plague on thee, what is in those boxes?; and she answered,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Dresses for the Lady Zubaydah;[FN#565] whereupon he, Open them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before me! When I heard this I died my death outright and said
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to myself, By Allah, today is the very last of my days in this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,world: if I come safe out of this I am to marry her and no more
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"words, but detection stares me in the face and my head is as good"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as stricken off. Then I repeated the profession of Faith,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, There is no god but the God, and Mohammed is the Apostle"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of God!--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Twenty-eighth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchant continued as follows: Now when I testified, I bear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"witness that there is no god save the God, I heard my mistress"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the handmaid declare to the Caliph, These chests, O Commander of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Faithful, have been committed to my charge by the Lady"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Zubaydah, and she doth not wish their contents to be seen by any"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one. No matter! quoth the Caliph, needs must they be opened,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I will see what is in them; and he cried aloud to the eunuchs,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Bring the chests here before me. At this I made sure of death
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,(without benefit of a doubt) and swooned away. Then the eunuchs
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brought the chests up to him one after another and he fell to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"inspecting the contents, but he saw in them only otters and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stuffs and fine dresses; and they ceased not opening the chests
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he ceased not looking to see what was in them, finding only"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clothes and such matters, till none remained unopened but the box"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in which I was boxed. They put forth their hands to open it, but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my mistress the handmaid made haste and said to the Caliph, This"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one thou shalt see only in the presence of the Lady Zubaydah, for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that which is in it is her secret. When he heard this he gave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,orders to carry in the chests; so they took up that wherein I was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and bore it with the rest into the Harim and set it down in the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,midst of the saloon; and indeed my spittle was dried up for very
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fear.[FN#566] Then my mistress opened the box and took me out,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, Fear not: no harm shall betide thee now nor dread; but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,broaden thy breast and strengthen thy heart and sit thee down
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till the Lady Zubaydah come, and surely thou shalt win thy wish"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of me. So I sat down and, after a while, in came ten hand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"maidens, virgins like moons, and ranged themselves in two rows,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"five facing five; and after them twenty other damsels, high"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bosomed virginity, surrounding the Lady Zubaydah who could hardly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,walk for the weight of her raiment and ornaments. As she drew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"near, the slave girls dispersed from around her, and I advanced"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and kissed the ground between her hands. She signed to me to sit
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, when I sat down before her chair, she began questioning me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of my forbears and family and condition, to which I made such"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answers that pleased her, and she said to my mistress, Our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nurturing of thee, O damsel, hath not disappointed us. Then she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to me, Know that this handmaiden is to us even as our own"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,child and she is a trust committed to thee by Allah. I again
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kissed the ground before her, well pleased that I should marry my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mistress, and she bade me abide ten days in the palace. So I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"abode there ten days, during which time I saw not my mistress nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"anybody save one of the concubines, who brought me the morning"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and evening meals. After this the Lady Zubaydah took counsel with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Caliph on the marriage of her favourite handmaid, and he gave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,leave and assigned to her a wedding portion of ten thousand gold
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pieces. So the Lady Zubaydah sent for the Kazi and witnesses who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wrote our marriage contract, after which the women made ready"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sweetmeats and rich viands and distributed them among all the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Odahs[FN#567] of the Harim. Thus they did other ten days, at the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,end of which time my mistress went to the baths.[FN#568]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Meanwhile, they set before me a tray of food where on were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"various meats and among those dishes, which were enough to daze"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the wits, was a bowl of cumin ragout containing chickens breasts,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fricandoed[FN#569] and flavoured with sugar, pistachios, musk and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rose water. Then, by Allah, fair sirs, I did not long hesitate;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but took my seat before the ragout and fell to and ate of it till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I could no more. After this I wiped my hands, but forgot to wash"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them; and sat till it grew dark, when the wax candles were"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lighted and the singing women came in with their tambourines and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,proceeded to display the bride in various dresses and to carry
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her in procession from room to room all round the palace, getting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,their palms crossed with gold. Then they brought her to me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disrobed her. When I found myself alone with her on the bed I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"embraced her, hardly believing in our union; but she smelt the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,strong odours of the ragout upon my hands and forth with cried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out with an exceeding loud cry, at which the slave girls came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"running to her from all sides. I trembled with alarm, unknowing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what was the matter, and the girls asked her, What aileth thee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O our sister? She answered them, Take this mad man away from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me: I had thought he was a man of sense! Quoth I to her, What"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"makes thee think me mad? Quoth she, Thou madman' what made thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eat of cumin ragout and forget to wash thy hand? By Allah, I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,requite thee for thy misconduct. Shall the like of thee come to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bed with the like of me with unclean hands?[FN#570] Then she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took from her side a plaited scourge and came down with it on my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,back and the place where I sit till her forearms were benumbed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I fainted away from the much beating; when she said to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"handmaids, Take him and carry him to the Chief of Police, that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he may strike off the hand wherewith he ate of the cumin ragout,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and which he did not wash. When I heard this I said, There is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! Wilt thou cut off
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my hand, because I ate of a cumin ragout and did not wash? The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"handmaidens also interceded with her and kissed her hand saying,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O our sister, this man is a simpleton, punish him not for what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he hath done this nonce; but she answered, By Allah, there is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"no help but that I dock him of somewhat, especially the offending"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,member. Then she went away and I saw no more of her for ten
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"days, during which time she sent me meat and drink by a slave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,girl who told me that she had fallen sick from the smell of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cumin ragout. After that time she came to me and said, O black"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of face![FN#571] I will teach thee how to eat cumin ragout
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"without washing thy hands! Then she cried out to the handmaids,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who pinioned me; and she took a sharp razor and cut off my thumbs
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and great toes; even as you see, O fair assembly! Thereupon I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"swooned away, and she sprinkled some powder of healing herbs upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the stumps and when the blood was stanched, I said, Never again"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will I eat of cumin ragout without washing my hands forty times
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with potash and forty times with galangale and forty times with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,soap! And she took of me an oath and bound me by a covenant to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that effect. When, therefore, you brought me the cumin ragout my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"colour changed and I said to myself, It was this very dish that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"caused the cutting off of my thumbs and great toes; and, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"you forced me, I said, Needs must I fulfil the oath I have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sworn. And what befell thee after this? asked those present;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he answered, When I swore to her, her anger was appeased and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I slept with her that night. We abode thus awhile till she said
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to me one day, Verily the Palace of the Caliph is not a pleasant"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"place for us to live in, and none ever entered it save thyself;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and thou only by grace of the Lady Zubaydah. Now she hath given
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me fifty thousand dinars, adding, Take this money and go out"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and buy us a fair dwelling house. So I fared forth and bought a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fine and spacious mansion, whither she removed all the wealth she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,owned and what riches I had gained in stuffs and costly rarities.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Such is the cause of the cutting off of my thumbs and great toes.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"We ate (continued the Reeve), and were returning to our homes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when there befell me with the Hunchback that thou wottest of.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"This then is my story, and peace be with thee! Quoth the King;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,This story is on no wise more delectable than the story of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hunchback; nay, it is even less so, and there is no help for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hanging of the whole of you. Then came forward the Jewish
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"physician and kissing the ground said, O King of the age, I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tell thee an history more wonderful than that of the Hunchback.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tell on, said the King of China; so he began the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Tale of the Jewish Doctor.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Right marvellous was a matter which came to pass to me in my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"youth. I lived in Damascus of Syria studying my art and, one day,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as I was sitting at home behold, there came to me a Mameluke from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the household of the Sahib and said to me, Speak with my lord!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So I followed him to the Viceroy's house and, entering the great"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hall, saw at its head a couch of cedar plated with gold whereon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lay a sickly youth beautiful withal; fairer than he one could not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,see. I sat down by his head and prayed to Heaven for a cure; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he made me a sign with his eyes, so I said to him, O my lord!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"favour me with thy hand, and safety be with thee![FN#572] Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he put forth his left hand and I marvelled thereat and said, By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, strange that this handsome youth, the son of a great"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house, should so lack good manners. This can be nothing but pride"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and conceit! However I felt his pulse and wrote him a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prescription and continued to visit him for ten days, at the end"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of which time he recovered and went to the Hammam,[FN#573]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whereupon the Viceroy gave me a handsome dress of honour and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,appointed me superintendent of the hospital which is in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Damascus.[FN#574] I accompanied him to the baths, the whole of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which they had kept private for his accommodation; and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,servants came in with him and took off his clothes within the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bath, and when he was stripped I saw that his right hand had been"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"newly cut off, and this was the cause of his weakliness. At this I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was amazed and grieved for him: then, looking at his body, I saw"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on it the scars of scourge stripes whereto he had applied
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,unguents. I was troubled at the sight and my concern appeared in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my face. The young man looked at me and, comprehending the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"matter, said, O Physician of the age, marvel not at my case; I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will tell thee my story as soon as we quit the baths. Then we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"washed and, returning to his house, ate somewhat of food and took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rest awhile; after which he asked me, What sayest thou to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,solacing thee by inspecting the supper hall?; and I answered So
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,let it be. Thereupon he ordered the slaves to carry out the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,carpets and cushions required and roast a lamb and bring us some
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fruit. They did his bidding and we ate together, he using the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"left hand for the purpose. After a while I said to him, Now tell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me thy tale. O Physician of the age, replied he, hear what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befell me. Know that I am of the sons of Mosul, where my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,grandfather died leaving nine children of whom my father was the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eldest. All grew up and took to them wives, but none of them was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blessed with offspring except my father, to whom Providence"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,vouchsafed me. So I grew up amongst my uncles who rejoiced in me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with exceeding joy, till I came to man's estate. One day which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"happened to be a Friday, I went to the Cathedral mosque of Mosul"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with my father and my uncles, and we prayed the congregational"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prayers, after which the folk went forth, except my father and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"uncles, who sat talking of wondrous things in foreign parts and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the marvellous sights of strange cities. At last they mentioned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Egypt, and one of my uncles said, Travellers tell us that there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is not on earth's face aught fairer than Cairo and her Nile; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"these words made me long to see Cairo. Quoth my father, Whoso"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hath not seen Cairo hath not seen the world. Her dust is golden
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and her Nile a miracle holden; and her women are as Houris fair;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"puppets, beautiful pictures; her houses are palaces rare; her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,water is sweet and light[FN#575] and her mud a commodity and a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"medicine beyond compare, even as said the poet in this his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,poetry:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Nile[FN#576] flood this day is the gain you own; * You alone
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     in such gain and bounties wone:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Nile is my tear flood of severance, * And here none is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     forlorn but I alone.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Moreover temperate is her air, and with fragrance blent, Which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"surpasseth aloes wood in scent; and how should it be otherwise,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she being the Mother of the World? And Allah favour him who wrote
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"An I quit Cairo and her pleasaunces, * Where can I wend to find"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     so gladsome ways?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shall I desert that site, whose grateful scents * Joy every soul"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and call for loudest praise?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Where every palace, as another Eden, * Carpets and cushions"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     richly wrought displays;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"A city wooing sight and sprite to glee, * Where Saint meets"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Sinner and each 'joys his craze;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Where friend meets friend, by Providence united * In greeny"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     garden and in palmy maze:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"People of Cairo, and by Allah's doom * I fare, with you in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thoughts I wone always!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Whisper not Cairo in the ear of Zephyr, * Lest for her like of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     garden scents he reave her,[FN#577]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And if your eyes saw her earth, and the adornment thereof with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bloom, and the purfling of it with all manner blossoms, and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,islands of the Nile and how much is therein of wide spread and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"goodly prospect, and if you bent your sight upon the Abyssinian"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Pond,[FN#578] your glance would not revert from the scene quit of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wonder; for nowhere would you behold the fellow of that lovely
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"view; and, indeed, the two arms of the Nile embrace most"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"luxuriant verdure,[FN#579] as the white of the eye encompasseth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,its black or like filigreed silver surrounding chrysolites. And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,divinely gifted was the poet who there anent said these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,couplets:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By th' Abyssinian Pond, O day divine!* In morning twilight and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     in sunny shine:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The water prisoned in its verdurous walls, * Like sabre flashes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     before shrinking eyne:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And in The Garden sat we while it drains * Slow draught, with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     purfled sides dyed finest fine:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The stream is rippled by the hands of clouds; * We too,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     a-rippling, on our rugs recline,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Passing pure wine, and whoso leaves us there * Shall ne'er arise"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     from fall his woes design:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Draining long draughts from large and brimming bowls, *"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Administ'ring thirst's only medicine--wine.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And what is there to compare with the Rasad, the Observatory, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"its charms whereof every viewer as he approacheth saith, 'Verily"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this spot is specialised with all manner of excellence!' And if
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou speak of the Night of Nile full,[FN#580] give the rainbow"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and distribute it![FN#581] And if thou behold The Garden at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eventide, with the cool shades sloping far and wide, a marvel"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou wouldst see and wouldst incline to Egypt in ecstasy. And
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wert thou by Cairo's river side,[FN#582] when the sun is sinking"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the stream dons mail coat and habergeon[FN#583] over its
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"other vestments, thou wouldst be quickened to new life by its"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gentle zephyrs and by its all sufficient shade. So spake he and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the rest fell to describing Egypt and her Nile. As I heard their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"accounts, my thoughts dwelt upon the subject and when, after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"talking their fill, all arose and went their ways, I lay down to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sleep that night, but sleep came not because of my violent"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,longing for Egypt; and neither meat pleased me nor drink. After a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,few days my uncles equipped themselves for a trade journey to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Egypt; and I wept before my father till he made ready for me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fitting merchandise, and he consented to my going with them,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying however, Let him not enter Cairo, but leave him to sell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his wares at Damascus. So I took leave of my father and we fared
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth from Mosul and gave not over travelling till we reached
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Aleppo[FN#584] where we halted certain days. Then we marched
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,onwards till we made Damascus and we found her a city as though
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she were a Paradise, abounding in trees and streams and birds and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fruits of all kinds. We alighted at one of the Khans, where my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,uncles tarried awhile selling and buying; and they bought and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sold also on my account, each dirham turning a profit of five on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prime cost, which pleased me mightily. After this they left me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"alone and set their faces Egyptwards; whilst I abode at Damascus,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"where I had hired from a jeweller, for two dinars a month, a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mansion[FN#585] whose beauties would beggar the tongue. Here I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"remained, eating and drinking and spending what monies I had in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hand till, one day, as I was sitting at the door of my house be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hold, there came up a young lady clad in costliest raiment never"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saw my eyes richer. I winked[FN#5886 at her and she stepped
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,inside without hesitation and stood within. I entered with her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and shut the door upon myself and her; whereupon she raised her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"face veil and threw off her mantilla, when I found her like a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pictured moon of rare and marvellous loveliness; and love of her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gat hold of my heart. So I rose and brought a tray of the most
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"delicate eatables and fruits and whatso befitted the occasion,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and we ate and played and after that we drank till the wine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,turned our heads. Then I lay with her the sweetest of nights and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in the morning I offered her ten gold pieces; when her face
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lowered and her eye brows wrinkled and shaking with wrath she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried, Fie upon thee, O my sweet companion! dost thou deem that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I covet thy money? Then she took out from the bosom of her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shift[FN#587] fifteen dinars and, laying them before me, said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,By Allah! unless thou take them I will never come back to thee.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So I accepted them and she said to me, O my beloved! expect me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again in three days' time, when I will be with thee between"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sunset and supper tide; and do thou prepare for us with these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dinars the same entertainment as yesternight. So saying, she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took leave of me and went away and all my senses went with her.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"On the third day she came again, clad in stuff weft with gold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wire, and wearing raiment and ornaments finer than before. I had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,prepared the place for her ere she arrived and the repast was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ready; so we ate and drank and lay together, as we had done, till"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the morning, when she gave me other fifteen gold pieces and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"promised to come again after three days. Accordingly, I made"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ready for her and, at the appointed time, she presented herself"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"more richly dressed than on the first and second occasions, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to me, O my lord, am I not beautiful? Yea, by Allah thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"art! answered I, and she went on, Wilt thou allow me to bring"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with me a young lady fairer than I, and younger in years, that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she may play with us and thou and she may laugh and make merry
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and rejoice her heart, for she hath been very sad this long time"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"past, and hath asked me to take her out and let her spend the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"night abroad with me? Yea, by Allah! I replied; and we drank"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till the wine turned our heads and slept till the morning, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she gave me other fifteen dinars, saying, Add something to thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,usual provision on account of the young lady who will come with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me. Then she went away, and on the fourth day I made ready the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house as usual, and soon after sunset behold, she came,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,accompanied by another damsel carefully wrapped in her mantilla.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,They entered and sat down; and when I saw them I repeated these
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"How dear is our day and how lucky our lot, * When the cynic's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     away with his tongue malign!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When love and delight and the swimming of head * Send
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     cleverness trotting, the best boon of wine."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When the full moon shines from the cloudy veil, * And the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     branchlet sways in her greens that shine:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When the red rose mantles in freshest cheek, * And"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Narcissus[FN#588] opeth his love sick eyne:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When pleasure with those I love is so sweet, * When friendship"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     with those I love is complete!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I rejoiced to see them, and lighted the candles after receiving"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them with gladness and delight. They doffed their heavy outer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dresses and the new damsel uncovered her face when I saw that she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was like the moon at its full never beheld I aught more
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beautiful. Then I rose and set meat and drink before them, and we"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ate and drank; and I kept giving mouthfuls to the new comer,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"crowning her cup and drinking with her till the first damsel,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waxing inwardly jealous, asked me, By Allah, is she not more"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"delicious than I?; whereto I answered, Ay, by the Lord! It is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my wish that thou lie with her this night; for I am thy mistress
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but she is our visitor. Upon my head be it, and my eyes. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she rose and spread the carpets for our bed[FN#589] and I took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the young lady and lay with her that night till morning, when I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"awoke and found myself wet, as I thought, with sweat. I sat up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and tried to arouse the damsel; but when I shook her by the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shoulders my hand became crimson with blood and her head rolled
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"off the pillow. Thereupon my senses fled and I cried aloud,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, O All powerful Protector, grant me Thy protection! Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"finding her neck had been severed, I sprung up and the world"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"waxed black before my eyes, and I looked for the lady, my former"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"love, but could not find her. So I knew that it was she who had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"murdered the damsel in her jealousy,[FN#590] and said, There is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Great! What is to be done now? I considered awhile then, doffing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my clothes, dug a hole in the middle of the court yard, wherein I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,laid the murdered girl with her jewellery and golden ornaments;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, throwing back the earth on her, replaced the slabs of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,marble[FN#591] pavement. After this I made the Ghusl or total
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ablution,[FN#592] and put on pure clothes; then, taking what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"money I had left, locked up the house and summoned courage and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went to its owner to whom I paid a year's rent, saying, I am"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"about to join my uncles in Cairo. Presently I set out and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"journeying to Egypt, foregathered with my uncles who rejoiced in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, and I found that they had made an end of selling their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"merchandise. They asked me, What is the cause of thy coming?;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I answered I longed for a sight of you; but did not let
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them know that I had any money with me. I abode with them a year,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"enjoying the pleasures of Cairo and her Nile,[FN#593] and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,squandering the rest of my money in feasting and carousing till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the time drew near for the departure of my uncles, when I fled"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from them and hid myself. They made enquiries and sought for me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but hearing no tidings they said, He will have gone back to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Damascus. When they departed I came forth from my hiding place
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and abode in Cairo three years, until naught remained of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,money. Now every year I used to send the rent of the Damascus
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house to its owner, until at last I had nothing left but enough"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to pay him for one year's rent and my breast was straitened. So I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"travelled to Damascus and alighted at the house whose owner, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"jeweller, was glad to see me and I found everything locked up as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I had left it. I opened the closets and took out my clothes and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"necessaries and came upon, beneath the carpet bed whereon I had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lain that night with the girl who had been beheaded, a golden"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"necklace set with ten gems of passing beauty. I took it up and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cleansing it of the blood, sat gazing upon it and wept awhile."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then I abode in the house two days and on the third I entered the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hammam and changed my clothes. I had no money by me now; so Satan
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whispered temptation to me that the Decree of Destiny be carried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out. Next day I took the jewelled necklace to the bazaar and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,handed it to a broker who made me sit down in the shop of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"jeweller, my landlord, and bade me have patience till the market"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was full,[FN#594] when he carried off the ornament and proclaimed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it for sale, privily and without my knowledge. The necklet was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"priced as worth two thousand dinars, but the broker returned to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me and said, This collar is of copper, a mere counterfeit after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the fashion of the Franks[FN#595] and a thousand dirhams have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"been bidden for it. Yes, I answered, I knew it to be copper,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,as we had it made for a certain person that we might mock her:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,now my wife hath inherited it and we wish to sell it; so go and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,take over the thousand dirhams.--And Shahrazad perceived the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Twenty-ninth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beautiful youth said to the broker, Take over the thousand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dirhams; and when the broker heard this, he knew that the case"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was suspicious. So he carried the collar to the Syndic of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bazaar, and the Syndic took it to the Governor who was also"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prefect of police, and said to him falsely enough, This necklet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was stolen from my house, and we have found the thief in traders'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dress. So before I was aware of it the watch got round me and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"making me their prisoner, carried me before the Governor who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,questioned me of the collar. I told him the tale I had told to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the broker; but he laughed and said, These words are not true."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then, before I knew what was doing, the guard stripped off my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clothes and came down with palm rods upon my ribs, till for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"smart of the stick I confessed, It was I who stole it; saying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to myself, 'Tis better for thee to say, I stole it, than to let"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them know that its owner was murdered in thy house, for then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would they slay thee to avenge her. So they wrote down that I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had stolen it and they cut off my hand and scalded the stump in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"oil,[FN#596] when I swooned away for pain; but they gave me wine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to drink and I recovered and, taking up my hand, was going to my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fine house, when my landlord said to me, Inasmuch, O my son, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this hath befallen thee, thou must leave my house and look out"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for another lodging for thee, since thou art convicted of theft."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thou art a handsome youth, but who will pity thee after this? O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my master said I, bear with me but two days or three, till I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"find me another place. He answered, So be it. and went away"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and left me. I returned to the house where I sat weeping and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, How shall I go back to my own people with my hand lopped"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,off and they know not that I am innocent? Perchance even after
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this Allah may order some matter for me. And I wept with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding weeping, grief beset me and I remained in sore trouble"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for two days; but on the third day my landlord came suddenly in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to me, and with him some of the guard and the Syndic of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bazaar, who had falsely charged me with stealing the necklet. I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went up to them and asked, What is the matter? however, they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pinioned me with out further parley and threw a chain about my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neck, saying, The necklet which was with thee hath proved to be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the property of the Wazir of Damascus who is also her Viceroy;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and they added, It was missing from his house three years ago at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the same time as his younger daughter. When I heard these words,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my heart sank within me and I said to myself, Thy life is gone"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beyond a doubt! By Allah, needs must I tell the Chief my story;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, if he will, let him kill me, and if he please, let him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pardon me. So they carried me to the Wazir's house and made me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stand between his hands. When he saw me, he glanced at me out of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the corner of his eye and said to those present, Why did ye lop"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"off his hand? This man is unfortunate, and there is no fault in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him; indeed ye have wronged him in cutting off his hand. When I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard this, I took heart and, my soul presaging good, I said to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, By Allah, O my lord, I am no thief; but they calumniated me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with a vile calumny, and they scourged me midmost the market,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bidding me confess till, for the pain of the rods, I lied against"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"myself and confessed the theft, albeit I am altogether innocent"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of it. Fear not, quoth the Viceroy, no harm shall come to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee. Then he ordered the Syndic of the bazaar to be imprisoned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said to him, Give this man the blood money for his hand;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, if thou delay I will hang thee and seize all thy property."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Moreover he called to his guards who took him and dragged him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"away, leaving me with the Chief. Then they loosed by his command"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the chain from my neck and unbound my arms; and he looked at me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, O my son, be true with me, and tell me how this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,necklace came to thee. And he repeated these verses:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Truth best befits thee, albeit truth * Shall bring thee to burn"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     on the threatened fire.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah, O my lord, answered I, I will tell thee nothing but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the truth. Then I related to him all that had passed between me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and the first lady, and how she had brought me the second and had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slain her out of jealousy, and I detailed for him the tale to its"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"full. When he heard my story, he shook his head and struck his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"right hand upon the left,[FN#597] and putting his kerchief over"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his face wept awhile and then repeated:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I see the woes of the world abound, * And worldings sick with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     spleen and teen;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"There's One who the meeting of two shall part, * And who part not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     are few and far between!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then he turned to me and said, Know, O my son, that the elder"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,damsel who first came to thee was my daughter whom I used to keep
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"closely guarded. When she grew up, I sent her to Cairo and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"married her to her cousin, my brother's son. After a while he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,died and she came back: but she had learnt wantonness and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ungraciousness from the people of Cairo;[FN#598] so she visited
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee four times and at last brought her younger sister. Now they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"were sisters-german and much attached to each other; and, when"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that adventure happened to the elder, she disclosed her secret to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her sister who desired to go out with her. So she asked thy leave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and carried her to thee; after which she returned alone and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"finding her weeping, I questioned her of her sister, but she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, 'I know nothing of her.' However, she presently told her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mother privily of what had happened and how she had cut off her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sister's head and her mother told me. Then she ceased not to weep
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and say, 'By Allah! I shall cry for her till I die.' Nor did she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,give over mourning till her heart broke and she died; and things
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell out after that fashion. See then, O my son, what hath come"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to pass; and now I desire thee not to thwart me in what I am
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"about to offer thee, and it is that I purpose to marry thee to my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,youngest daughter; for she is a virgin and born of another
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mother;[FN#599] and I will take no dower of thee but, on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"contrary, will appoint thee an allowance, and thou shalt abide"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with me in my house in the stead of my son. So be it, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, and how could I hope for such good fortune? Then he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sent at once for the Kazi and witnesses, and let write my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,marriage contract with his daughter and I went in to her.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Moreover, he got me from the Syndic of the bazaar a large sum of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,money and I became in high favour with him. During this year news
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came to me that my father was dead and the Wazir despatched a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"courier, with letters bearing the royal sign manual, to fetch me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the money which my father had left behind him, and now I am"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,living in all the solace of life. Such was the manner of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cutting off my right hand. I marvelled at his story (continued
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Jew), and I abode with him three days after which he gave me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"much wealth, and I set out and travelled Eastward till I reached"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this your city and the sojourn suited me right well; so I took up
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my abode here and there befell me what thou knowest with the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hunchback. There upon the King of China shook his head[FN#600]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, This story of thine is not stranger and more wondrous"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and marvellous and delectable than the tale of the Hunchback; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so needs must I hang the whole number of you. However there yet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,remains the Tailor who is the head of all the offence; and he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"added, O Tailor, if thou canst tell me any thing more wonderful"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than the story of the Hunchback, I will pardon you all your"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,offences. Thereupon the man came forward and began to tell the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Tale of the Tailor.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O King of the age, that most marvellous was that which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befell me but yesterday, before I foregathered with the Hunch"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,back. It so chanced that in the early day I was at the marriage
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feast of one of my companions, who had gotten together in his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house some twenty of the handicraftsmen of this city, amongst"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them tailors and silk spinners and carpenters and others of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"same kidney. As soon as the sun had risen, they set food[FN#601]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before us that we might eat when behold, the master of the house"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entered, and with him a foreign youth and a well favoured of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"people of Baghdad, wearing clothes as handsome as handsome could"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be; and he was of right comely presence save that he was lame of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one leg. He came and saluted us and we stood up to receive him;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but when he was about to sit down he espied amongst us a certain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,man which was a Barber; whereupon he refused to be seated and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would have gone away. But we stopped him and our host also stayed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, making oath that he should not leave us and asked him, What"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is the reason of thy coming in and going out again at once?;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereto he answered, By Allah, O my lord, do not hinder me; for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the cause of my turning back is yon Barber of bad omen,[FN#602]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yon black o'face, yon ne'er do well! When the housemaster heard"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"these words he marvelled with extreme marvel and said, How"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cometh this young man, who haileth from Baghdad, to be so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,troubled and perplexed about this Barber? Then we looked at the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stranger and said, Explain the cause of thine anger against the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Barber. O fair company, quoth the youth, there befell me a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,strange adventure with this Barber in Baghdad (which is my native
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,city); he was the cause of the breaking of my leg and of my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lameness, and I have sworn never to sit in the same place with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, nor even tarry in any town where he happens to abide; and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have bidden adieu to Baghdad and travelled far from it and came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to stay in this your city; yet I have hardly passed one night
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before I meet him again. But not another day shall go by ere I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fare forth from here. Said we to him, Allah upon thee, tell us"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the tale; and the youth replied (the Barber changing colour from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brown to yellow as he spoke): Know, O fair company, that my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"father was one of the chief merchants of Baghdad, and Almighty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah had blessed him with no son but myself. When I grew up and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reached man's estate, my father was received into the mercy of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah (whose Name be exalted!) and left me money and eunuchs,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,servants and slaves; and I used to dress well and diet well. Now
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah had made me a hater of women kind and one day, as I was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"walking along a street in Baghdad, a party of females met me face"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to face in the footway; so I fled from them and, entering an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"alley which was no thoroughfare, sat down upon a stone bench at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,its other end. I had not sat there long before the latticed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"window of one of the houses opposite was thrown open, and there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"appeared at it a young lady, as she were the full moon at its"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fullest; never in my life saw I her like; and she began to water
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,some flowers on the window sill.[FN#603] She turned right and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"left and, seeing me watching her, shut the window and went away."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thereupon fire was suddenly enkindled in my heart; my mind was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,possessed with her and my woman hate turned to woman love. I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"continued sitting there, lost to the world, till sunset when lo!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Kazi of the city came riding by with his slaves before him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and his eunuchs behind him, and dismounting entered the house in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which the damsel had appeared. By this I knew that he was her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,father; so I went home sorrowful and cast myself upon my carpet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bed in grief. Then my handmaids flocked in and sat about me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unknowing what ailed me; but I addressed no speech to them, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they wept and wailed over me. Presently in came an old woman who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,looked at me and saw with a glance what was the matter with me:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"so she by my head spoke me fair, saying, O my son, tell me all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,about it and I will be the means of thy union with her.[FN#604]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So I related to her what had happened and she answered, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son, this one is the daughter of the Kazi of Baghdad who keepeth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her in the closest seclusion; and the window where thou sawest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her is her floor, whilst her father occupies the large saloon in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the lower story. She is often there alone and I am wont to visit
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,at the house; so thou shalt not win to her save through me. Now
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,set thy wits to work and be of good cheer. With these words she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went away and I took heart at what she said and my people
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoiced that day, seeing me rise in the morning safe and sound."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By and by the old woman returned looking chopfallen,[FN#605] and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, O my son, do not ask me how I fared with her! When I told"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her that, she cried at me, 'If thou hold not thy peace, O hag of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ill omen, and leave not such talk, I will entreat thee as thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,deservest and do thee die by the foulest of deaths.' But needs
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,must I have at her a second time.[FN#606] When I heard this it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,added ailment to my ailment and the neighbours visited me and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"judged that I was not long for this world; but after some days,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the old woman came to me and, putting her mouth close to my ear,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whispered, O my son; I claim from thee the gift of good news."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"With this my soul returned to me and I said, Whatever thou wilt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shall be thine. Thereupon she began, Yesterday I went to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young lady who, seeing me broken in spirit and shedding tears"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"from reddened eyes, asked me, 'O naunty[FN#607] mine, what ails"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee, that I see thy breast so straitened?'; and I answered her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"weeping bitterly, 'O my lady, I am just come from the house of a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,youth who loves thee and who is about to die for sake of thee!'
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth she (and her heart was softened), 'And who is this youth of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whom thou speakest?'; and quoth I, 'He is to me as a son and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fruit of my vitals. He saw thee, some days ago, at the window"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,watering thy flowers and espying thy face and wrists he fell in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,love at first sight. I let him know what happened to me the last
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"time I was with thee, whereupon his ailment increased, he took to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the pillow and he is naught now but a dead man, and no doubt what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ever of it.' At this she turned pale and asked, 'All this for my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sake?'; and I answered, 'Ay, by Allah![FN#608] what wouldst thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have me do?' Said she, 'Go back to him and greet him for me and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tell him that I am twice more heartsick than he is. And on
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Friday, before the hour of public prayer, bid him here to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house, and I will come down and open the door for him. Then I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will carry him up to my chamber and foregather with him for a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"while, and let him depart before my father return from the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Mosque.' When I heard the old woman's words, all my sickness"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"suddenly fell from me, my anguish ceased and my heart was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,comforted; I took off what clothes were on me and gave them to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her and, as she turned to go, she said, Keep a good heart! I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have not a jot of sorrow left. I replied. My household and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"intimates rejoiced in my recovery and I abode thus till Friday,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when behold, the old woman came in and asked me how I did, to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which I answered that I was well and in good case. Then I donned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my clothes and perfumed myself and sat down to await the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"congregation going in to prayers, that I might betake myself to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her. But the old woman said to me, Thou hast time and to spare:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so thou wouldst do well to go to the Hammam and have thy hair
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shaven off (especially after thy ailment), so as not to show"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"traces of sickness. This were the best way, answered I, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have just now bathed in hot water, but I will have my head"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shaved. Then I said to my page, Go to the bazaar and bring me a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"barber, a discreet fellow and one not inclined to meddling or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,impertinent curiosity or likely to split my head with his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,excessive talk.[FN#609] The boy went out at once and brought
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"back with him this wretched old man, this Shaykh of ill omen."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,When he came in he saluted me and I returned his salutation; then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"quoth he, Of a truth I see thee thin of body; and quoth I, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have been ailing. He continued, Allah drive far away from thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy woe and thy sorrow and thy trouble and thy distress. Allah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grant thy prayer! said I. He pursued, All gladness to thee, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my master, for indeed recovery is come to thee. Dost thou wish to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,be polled or to be blooded? Indeed it was a tradition of Ibn
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Abbas[FN#610] (Allah accept of him!) that the Apostle said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"'Whoso cutteth his hair on a Friday, the Lord shall avert from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him threescore and ten calamities;' and again is related of him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"also that he said, 'Cupping on a Friday keepeth from loss of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sight and a host of diseases.' Leave this talk, I cried;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"come, shave me my head at once for I can't stand it. So he rose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and put forth his hand in most leisurely way and took out a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kerchief and unfolded it, and lo! it contained an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,astrolabe[FN#611] with seven parallel plates mounted in silver.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he went to the middle of the court and raised head and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,instrument towards the sun's rays and looked for a long while.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When this was over, he came back and said to me, Know that there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have elapsed of this our day, which be Friday, and this Friday be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the tenth of the month Safar in the six hundred and fifty- third
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,year since the Hegira or Flight of the Apostle (on whom be the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bestest of blessings and peace!) and the seven thousand three
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hundred and twentieth year of the era of Alexander, eight degrees"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and six minutes. Furthermore the ascendant of this our day is,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"according to the exactest science of computation, the planet"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Mars; and it so happeneth that Mercury is in conjunction with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, denoting an auspicious moment for hair cutting; and this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,also maketh manifest to me that thou desires union with a certain
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,person and that your intercourse will not be propitious. But
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after this there occurreth a sign respecting a matter which will
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befall thee and whereof I will not speak. O thou, cried I, by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, thou weariest me and scatterest my wits and thy forecast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is other than good; I sent for thee to poll my head and naught
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"else: so up and shave me and prolong not thy speech. By Allah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied he, if thou but knew what is about to befall thee, thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wouldst do nothing this day, and I counsel thee to act as I tell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee by computation of the constellations. By Allah, said I,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,never did I see a barber who excelled in judicial astrology save
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thyself: but I think and I know that thou art most prodigal of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"frivolous talk. I sent for thee only to shave my head, but thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,comest and pesterest me with this sorry prattle. What more
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wouldst thou have? replied he. Allah hath bounteously bestowed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on thee a Barber who is an astrologer, one learned in alchemy and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"white magic;[FN#612] syntax, grammar, and lexicology; the arts of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"logic, rhetoric and elocution; mathematics, arithmetic and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"algebra; astronomy, astromancy and geometry; theology, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Traditions of the Apostle and the Commentaries on the Koran.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Furthermore, I have read books galore and digested them and have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had experience of affairs and comprehended them. In short I have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,learned the theorick and the practick of all the arts and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sciences; I know everything of them by rote and I am a past
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,master in tota re scibili. Thy father loved me for my lack of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"officiousness, argal, to serve thee is a religious duty incumbent"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on me. I am no busy body as thou seemest to suppose, and on this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"account I am known as The Silent Man, also, The Modest Man."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wherefore it behoveth thee to render thanks to Allah Almighty and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not cross me, for I am a true counsellor to thee and benevolently"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,minded towards thee. Would that I were in thy service a whole
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,year that thou mightest do me justice; and I would ask thee no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wage for all this. When I heard his flow of words, I said to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, Doubtless thou wilt be my death this day!--And Shahrazad"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"                When it was the Thirtieth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man said to the Barber, Thou certainly will be the death of me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this very day! O master mine, replied he, I am he, The Silent"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Man hight, by reason of the fewness of my words, to distinguish"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me from my six brothers. For the eldest is called Al-Bakbúk, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prattler; the second Al-Haddár, the babbler; the third Al-Fakík,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the gabbler; the fourth, his name is Al-Kuz al-aswáni, the long"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"necked Gugglet, from his eternal chattering; the fifth is Al-"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nashshár, the tattler and tale teller; the sixth Shakáshik, or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"many clamours; and the seventh is famous as Al-Sámit, The Silent"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Man, and this is my noble self! Whilst he redoubled his talk, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thought my gall bladder would have burst; so I said to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"servant, Give him a quarter dinar and dismiss him and let him go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from me in the name of God who made him. I won't have my head
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shaved to day. What words be these, O my lord? cried he. By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah! I will accept no hire of thee till I have served thee and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have ministered to thy wants; and I care not if I never take
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"money of thee. If thou know not my quality, I know thine; and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"owe thy father, an honest man, on whom Allah Almighty have mercy!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"many a kindness, for he was a liberal soul and a generous. By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, he sent for me one day, as it were this blessed day, and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went in to him and found a party of his intimates about him.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth he to me, 'Let me blood;' so I pulled out my astrolabe and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"taking the sun's altitude for him, I ascertained that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ascendant was inauspicious and the hour unfavourable for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brooding. I told him of this, and he did according to my bidding"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and awaited a better opportunity. So I made these lines in honour
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of him:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I went to my patron some blood to let him, * But found that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     moment was far from good:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"So I sat and I talked of all strangenesses, * And with jests and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     jokes his good will I wooed:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"They pleased him and cried he, 'O man of wit, * Thou hast proved"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     thee perfect in merry mood!'
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Quoth I, 'O thou Lord of men, save thou * Lend me art and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     wisdom I'm fou and wood
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"In thee gather grace, boon, bounty, suavity, * And I guerdon the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     world with lore, science and gravity.'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Thy father was delighted and cried out to the servant, 'Give him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,an hundred and three gold pieces with a robe of honour!' The man
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"obeyed his orders, and I awaited an auspicious moment, when I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blooded him; and he did not baulk me; nay he thanked me and I was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,also thanked and praised by all present. When the blood-letting
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was over I had no power to keep silence and asked him, 'By Allah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"O my lord, what made thee say to the servant, Give him an hundred"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and three dinars?'; and he answered, 'One dinar was for the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"astrological observation, another for thy pleasant conversation,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the third for the phlebotomisation, and the remaining hundred and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the dress were for thy verses in my commendation.' May Allah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"show small mercy to my father, exclaimed I, for knowing the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like of thee. He laughed and ejaculated, There is no god but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God! Glory to Him that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"changeth and is changed not! I took thee for a man of sense, but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I see thou babblest and dotest for illness. Allah hath said in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Blessed Book,[FN#613] 'Paradise is prepared for the goodly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who bridle their anger and forgive men.' and so forth; and in any
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,case thou art excused. Yet I cannot conceive the cause of thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hurry and flurry; and thou must know that thy father and thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grandfather did nothing without consulting me, and indeed it hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"been said truly enough, 'Let the adviser be prized'; and, 'There"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"is no vice in advice'; and it is also said in certain saws,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"'Whoso hath no counsellor elder than he, will never himself an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,elder be';[FN#614] and the poet says:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Whatever needful thing thou undertake, * Consult th' experienced"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     and contraire him not!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And indeed thou shalt never find a man better versed in affairs
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than I, and I am here standing on my feet to serve thee. I am not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,vexed with thee: why shouldest thou be vexed with me? But
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whatever happen I will bear patiently with thee in memory of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"much kindness thy father shewed me. By Allah, cried I, O thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with tongue long as the tail of a jackass, thou persistest in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pestering me with thy prate and thou becomest more longsome in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy long speeches, when all I want of thee is to shave my head"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and wend thy way! Then he lathered my head saying, I perceive"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou art vexed with me, but I will not take it ill of thee, for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy wit is weak and thou art but a laddy: it was only yesterday I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,used to take thee on my shoulder[FN#615] and carry thee to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"school.' O my brother, said I, for Allah's sake do what I want"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and go thy gait! And I rent my garments.[FN#616] When he saw me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,do this he took the razor and fell to sharpening it and gave not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,over stropping it until my senses were well nigh leaving me. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he came up to me and shaved part of my head; then he held his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hand and then he said, O my lord, haste is Satan's gait whilst"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"patience is of Allah the Compassionate. But thou, O my master, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ken thou knowest not my rank; for verily this hand alighteth upon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the heads of Kings and Emirs and Wazirs, and sages and doctors"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"learned in the law, and the poet said of one like me:--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"All crafts are like necklaces strung on a string, * But this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Barber's the union pear of the band:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"High over all craftsmen he ranketh, and why? * The heads of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     Kings are under his hand![FN#617]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then said I, Do leave off talking about what concerneth thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not: indeed thou hast straitened my breast and distracted my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mind. Quoth he, Meseems thou art a hasty man; and quoth I,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Yes ! yes! yes! and he, I rede thee practice restraint of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"self, for haste is Satan's pelf which bequeatheth only repentance"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and ban and bane, and He (upon whom be blessings and peace!) hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, 'The best of works is that wherein deliberation lurks;' but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I, by Allah! have some doubt about thine affair; and so I should"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like thee to let me know what it is thou art in such haste to do,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for I fear me it is other than good. Then he continued, It"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wanteth three hours yet to prayer time; but I do not wish to be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in doubt upon this matter; nay, I must know the moment exactly,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for truly, 'A guess shot in times of doubt, oft brings harm"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"about;' especially in the like of me, a superior person whose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,merits are famous amongst mankind at large; and it doth not befit
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me to talk at random, as do the common sort of astrologers. So"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, he threw down the razor and taking up the astrolabe, went"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth under the sun and stood there a long time; after which he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned and counting on his fingers said to me, There remain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"still to prayer time three full hours and complete, neither more"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nor yet less, according to the most learned astronomicals and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wisest makers of almanacks. Allah upon thee, cried I, hold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy tongue with me, for thou breakest my liver in pieces. So he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"took the razor and, after sharpening it as before and shaving"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"other two hairs of my head, he again held his hand and said, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,am concerned about thy hastiness and indeed thou wouldst do well
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to let me into the cause of it; 't were the better for thee, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou knowest that neither thy father nor thy grandfather ever did
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a single thing save by my advice. When I saw that there was no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"escape from him I said to myself, The time for prayer draws near"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and I wish to go to her before the folk come out of the mosque.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"If I am delayed much longer, I know not how to come at her. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said I aloud, Be quick and stint this talk and impertinence, for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I have to go to a party at the house of some of my intimates.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When he heard me speak of the party, he said, This thy day is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blessed day for me! In very sooth it was but yesterday I invited
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a company of my friends and I have forgotten to provide anything
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for them to eat. This very moment I was thinking of it: Alas, how"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I shall be disgraced in their eyes! Be not distressed about
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this matter, answered I; have I not told thee that I am bidden"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to an entertainment this day? So every thing in my house, eatable"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and drinkable, shall be thine, if thou wilt only get through thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"work and make haste to shave my head. He replied, Allah requite"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee with good! Specify to me what is in thy house for my guests
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that I may be ware of it. Quoth I, Five dishes of meat and ten"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,chickens with reddened breasts[FN#618] and a roasted lamb. Set
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them before me, quoth he that I may see them. So I told my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"people to buy, borrow or steal them and bring them in anywise,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And had all this set before him. When he saw it he cried, The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wine is wanting, and I replied, I have a flagon or two of good"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"old grape- juice in the house, and he said, Have it brought"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out! So I sent for it and he exclaimed, Allah bless thee for a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,generous disposition! But there are still the essences and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perfumes. So I bade them set before him a box containing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Nadd,[FN#619] the best of compound perfumes, together with fine"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lign-aloes, ambergris and musk unmixed, the whole worth fifty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dinars. Now the time waxed strait and my heart straitened with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it; so I said to him, Take it all and finish shaving my head by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the life of Mohammed (whom Allah bless and keep!). By Allah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said he, I will not take it till I see all that is in it. So I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bade the page open the box and the Barber laid down the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"astrolabe, leaving the greater part of my head unpolled; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sitting on the ground, turned over the scents and incense and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,aloes wood and essences till I was well nigh distraught. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,took the razor and coming up to me shaved off some few hairs and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,repeated these lines:--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The boy like his father shall surely show, * As the tree from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     its parent root shall grow.[FN#620]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then said he, By Allah, O my son, I know not whether to thank"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee or thy father; for my entertainment this day is all due to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy bounty and beneficence; and, although none of my company be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"worthy of it, yet I have a set of honourable men, to wit Zantut"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the bath-keeper and Sali'a the corn-chandler; and Silat the bean-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seller; and Akrashah the greengrocer; and Humayd the scavenger;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and Sa'id the camel-man; and Suwayd the porter; and Abu Makarish
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the bathman;[FN#621] and Kasim the watchman; and Karim the groom.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,There is not among the whole of them a bore or a bully in his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cups; nor a meddler nor a miser of his money, and each and every"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hath some dance which he danceth and some of his own couplets
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which he caroleth; and the best of them is that, like thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"servant, thy slave here, they know not what much talking is nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what forwardness means. The bath keeper sings to the tom-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tom[FN#622] a song which enchants; and he stands up and dances
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and chants,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"    'I am going, O mammy, to fill up my pot.'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,As for the corn-chandler he brings more skill to it than any; he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dances and sings,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"    'O Keener,[FN#623] 0 sweetheart, thou fallest not short'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he leaves no one's vitals sound for laughing at him. But the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,scavenger sings so that the birds stop to listen to him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dances and sings,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,    'News my wife wots is not locked in a box!'[FN#624]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"And he hath privilege, for 'tis a shrewd rogue[FN#625] and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"witty; and speaking of his excellence I am wont to say,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"My life for the scavenger! right well I love him, * Like a waving"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     bough he is sweet to my sight:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Fate joined us one night, when to him quoth I * (The while I grew"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     weak and love gained more might)
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"'Thy love burns my heart!' 'And no wonder,' quoth he * 'When the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     drawer of dung turns a stoker wight.'[FN#626]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And indeed each is perfect in whatso can charm the wit with joy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and jollity; adding presently, But hearing is not seeing; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,indeed if thou make up thy mind to join us and put off going to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy friends, 'twill be better for us and for thee. The traces of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,illness are yet upon thee and haply thou art going among folk who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be mighty talkers, men who commune together of what concerneth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them not; or there may be amongst them some forward fellow who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will split thy head, and thou half thy size from sickness. This"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shall be for some other day, answered I, and laughed with heart"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"angered: finish thy work and go, in Allah Almighty's guard, to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy friends, for they will be expecting thy coming. O my lord,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied he, I seek only to introduce thee to these fellows of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"infinite mirth, the sons of men of worth, amongst whom there is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neither procacity nor dicacity nor loquacity; for never, since I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grew to years of discretion, could I endure to consort with one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who asketh questions concerning what concerneth him not, nor have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I ever frequented any save those who are, like myself, men of few"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,words. In sooth if thou were to company with them or even to see
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"them once, thou wouldst forsake all thy intimates. Allah fulfil"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy joyance with them, said I, needs must I come amongst them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"some day or other. But he said, Would it were this very day,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for I had set my heart upon thy making one of us; yet if thou
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"must go to thy friends to day, I will take these good things,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wherewith thou hast honoured and favoured me, to my guests and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,leave them to eat and drink and not wait for me; whilst I will
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,return to thee in haste and accompany thee to thy little party;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for there is no ceremony between me and my intimates to prevent
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my leaving them. Fear not, I will soon be back with thee and wend"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with thee whithersoever thou wendest. There is no Majesty and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shouted, Go thou to thy friends and make merry with them; and do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"let me go to mine and be with them this day, for they expect me."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"But the Barber cried, I will not let thee go alone; and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, The truth is none can enter where I am going save"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"myself. He rejoined, I suspect that to day thou art for an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"assignation with some woman, else thou hadst taken me with thee;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yet am I the right man to take, one who could aid thee to the end"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou wishest. But I fear me thou art running after strange women
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and thou wilt lose thy life; for in this our city of Baghdad one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cannot do any thing in this line, especially on a day like"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Friday: our Governor is an angry man and a mighty sharp blade.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Shame on thee, thou wicked, bad, old man! cried I, Be off!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what words are these thou givest me? O cold of wit,[FN#627]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cried he, thou sayest to me what is not true and thou hidest thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mind from me, but I know the whole business for certain and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seek only to help thee this day with my best endeavour. I was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fearful lest my people or my neighbours should hear the Barber's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"talk, so I kept silence for a long time whilst he finished"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shaving my head; by which time the hour of prayer was come and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Khutbah, or sermon, was about to follow. When he had done, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to him, Go to thy friends with their meat and drink, and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will await thy return. Then we will fare together. In this way I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hoped to pour oil on troubled waters and to trick the accursed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"loon, so haply I might get quit of him; but he said, Thou art"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cozening me and thou wouldst go alone to thy appointment and cast
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thyself into jeopardy, whence there will be no escape for thee."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now by Allah! and again by Allah! do not go till I return, that I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,may accompany thee and watch the issue of thine affair. So be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it, I replied, do not be long absent. Then he took all the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,meat and drink I had given him and the rest of it and went out of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my house; but the accursed carle gave it in charge of a porter to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,carry to his home but hid himself in one of the alleys. As for me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I rose on the instant, for the Muezzins had already called the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Salam of Friday, the salute to the Apostle;[FN#628] and I dressed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in haste and went out alone and, hurrying to the street, took my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stand by the house wherein I had seen the young lady. I found the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"old woman on guard at the door awaiting me, and went up with her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the upper story, the damsel's apartment. Hardly had I reached"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it when behold, the master of the house returned from prayers and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"entering the great saloon, closed the door. I looked down from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the window and saw this Barber (Allah's curse upon him!) sitting
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"over against the door and said, How did this devil find me out?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"At this very moment, as Allah had decreed it for rending my veil"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of secrecy, it so happened that a handmaid of the house master"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,committed some offence for which he beat her. She shrieked out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and his slave ran in to intercede for her, whereupon the Kazi"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beat him to boot, and he also roared out. The damned Barber"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fancied that it was I who was being beaten; so he also fell to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shouting and tore his garments and scattered dust on his head and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kept on shrieking and crying Help ! Help ! So the people came
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"round about him and he went on yelling, My master is being"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,murdered in the Kazi's house! Then he ran clamouring to my place
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with the folk after him, and told my people and servants and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slaves; and, before I knew what was doing, up they came tearing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their clothes and letting loose their hair[FN#629] and shouting,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Alas, our master!; and this Barber leading the rout with his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,clothes rent and in sorriest plight; and he also shouting like a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"madman and saying, Alas for our murdered master! And they all"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made an assault upon the house in which I was. The Kazi, hearing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the yells and the uproar at his door, said to one of his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"servants, See what is the matter; and the man went forth and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned and said, O my master, at the gate there are more than"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ten thousand souls what with men and women, and all crying out,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,'Alas for our murdered master!'; and they keep pointing to our
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house. When the Kazi heard this, the matter seemed serious and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he waxed wroth; so he rose and opening the door saw a great crowd
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of people; whereat he was astounded and said, O folk! what is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there to do? O accursed! O dog! O hog! my servants replied;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Tis thou who hast killed our master! Quoth he, O good folk,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and what hath your master done to me that I should kill him?--
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Thirty-first Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Kazi"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to the servants, What hath your master done to me that I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,should kill him? This is my house and it is open to you all.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then quoth the Barber, Thou didst beat him and I heard him cry"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out; and quoth the Kazi, But what was he doing that I should"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beat him, and what brought him in to my house; and whence came he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and whither went he? Be not a wicked, perverse old man! cried"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Barber, for I know the whole story; and the long and short"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of it is that thy daughter is in love with him and he loves her;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and when thou knewest that he had entered the house, thou badest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy servants beat him and they did so: by Allah, none shall judge"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,between us and thee but the Caliph; or else do thou bring out our
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"master that his folk may take him, before they go in and save him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"perforce from thy house, and thou be put to shame. Then said the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Kazi (and his tongue was bridled and his mouth was stopped by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"confusion before the people), An thou say sooth, do thou come in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and fetch him out. Whereupon the Barber pushed forward and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,entered the house. When I saw this I looked about for a means of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"escape and flight, but saw no hiding place except a great chest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in the upper chamber where I was. So I got into it and pulled the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lid down upon myself and held my breath. The Barber was hardly in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the room before he began to look about for me, then turned him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"right and left and came straight to the place where I was, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stepped up to the chest and, lifting it on his head, made off as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fast as he could. At this, my reason forsook me, for I knew that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he would not let me be; so I took courage and opening the chest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"threw myself to the ground. My leg was broken in the fall, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the door being open I saw a great concourse of people looking in.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now I carried in my sleeve much gold and some silver, which I had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,provided for an ill day like this and the like of such occasion;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so I kept scattering it amongst the folk to divert their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"attention from me and, whilst they were busy scrambling for it, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"set off, hopping as fast as I could, through the by streets of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Baghdad, shifting and turning right and left. But whithersoever I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went this damned Barber would go in after me, crying aloud, They"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would have bereft me of my master! They would have slain him who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was a benefactor to me and my family and my friends! Praised be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah who made me prevail against them and delivered my lord from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their hands! Then to me, Where wilt thou go now? Thou wouldst"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"persist in following thine own evil devices, till thou broughtest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thyself to this ill pass; and, had not Allah vouchsafed me to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee, ne'er hadst thou escaped this strait into which thou hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fallen, for they would have cast thee into a calamity whence thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,never couldest have won free. But I will not call thee to account
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for thine ignorance, as thou art so little of wit and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"inconsequential and addicted to hastiness! Said I to him, Doth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not what thou hast brought upon me suffice thee, but thou must"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,run after me and talk me such talk in the bazaar streets? And I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,well nigh gave up the ghost for excess of rage against him. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I took refuge in the shop of a weaver amiddlemost of the market
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and sought protection of the owner who drove the Barber away;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, sitting in the back room,[FN#630] I said to myself, If I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,return home I shall never be able to get rid of this curse of a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Barber, who will be with me night and day; and I cannot endure"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the sight of him even for a breathing space. So I sent out at
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"once for witnesses and made a will, dividing the greater part of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my property among my people, and appointed a guardian over them,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to whom I committed the charge of great and small, directing him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to sell my houses and domains. Then I set out on my travels that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I might be free of this pimp;[FN#631] and I came to settle in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,your town where I have lived some time. When you invited me and I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came hither, the first thing I saw was this accursed pander"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seated in the place of honour. How then can my heart be glad and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,my stay be pleasant in company with this fellow who brought all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this upon me, and who was the cause of the breaking of my leg and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of my exile from home and native land. And the youth refused to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sit down and went away. When we heard his story (continued the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Tailor) we were amazed beyond measure and amused and said to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Barber, By Allah, is it true what this young man saith of thee?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"By Allah, replied he, I dealt thus by him of my courtesy and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sound sense and generosity. Had it not been for me he had
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perished and none but I was the cause of his escape. Well it was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for him that he suffered in his leg and not in his life! Had I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"been a man of many words, a meddler, a busy body, I had not acted"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thus kindly by him; but now I will tell you a tale which befell
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, that you may be well assured I am a man sparing of speech in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whom is no forwardness and a very different person from those six
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Brothers of mine; and this it is.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Barber's Tale of Himself.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I was living in Baghdad during the times of Al-Mustansir
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bi'llah,[FN#632] Son of Al-Mustazi bi'llah the then Caliph, a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,prince who loved the poor and needy and companied with the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,learned and pious. One day it happened to him that he was wroth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with ten persons, highwaymen who robbed on the Caliph's highway,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he ordered the Prefect of Baghdad to bring them into the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,presence on the anniversary of the Great Festival.[FN#633] So the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Prefect sallied out and, making them His prisoners, embarked with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them in a boat. I caught sight of them as they were embarking and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to myself, These are surely assembled for a marriage feast;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,methinks they are spending their day in that boat eating and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"drinking, and none shall be companion of their cups but I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"myself. So I rose, O fair assembly; and, of the excess of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"courtesy and the gravity of my understanding, I embarked with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,them and entered into conversation with them. They rowed across
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the opposite bank, where they landed and there came up the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"watch and guardians of the peace with chains, which they put"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,round the robbers' necks. They chained me among the rest of them;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, O people, is it not a proof of my courtesy and spareness of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"speech, that I held my peace and did not please to speak? Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,they took us away in bilbos and next morning carried us all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before Al- Mustansir bi'llah, Commander of the Faithful, who bade"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,smite the necks of the ten robbers. So the Sworder came forward
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after they were seated on the leather of blood;[FN#634] then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"drawing his blade, struck off one head after another until he had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,smitten the neck of the tenth; and I alone remained. The Caliph
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"looked at me and asked the Heads man, saying, What ails thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that thou hast struck off only nine heads?; and he answered,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah forbid that I should behead only nine, when thou biddest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me behead ten! Quoth the Caliph, Meseems thou hast smitten the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"necks of only nine, and this man before thee is the tenth. By"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy beneficence! replied the Headsman, I have beheaded ten."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Count them! cried the Caliph and whenas they counted heads, lo!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"there were ten. The Caliph looked at me and said, What made thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,keep silence at a time like this and how camest thou to company
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with these men of blood? Tell me the cause of all this, for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"albeit thou art a very old man, assuredly thy wits are weak. Now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when I heard these words from the Caliph I sprang to my feet and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that I am the Silent"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Shaykh and am thus called to distinguish me from my six brothers.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I am a man of immense learning whilst, as for the gravity of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"understanding, the wiliness of my wits and the spareness of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"speech, there is no end of them; and my calling is that of a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,barber. I went out early on yesterday morning and saw these men
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"making for a skiff; and, fancying they were bound for a marriage"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"feast, I joined them and mixed with them. After a while up came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the watch and guardians of the peace, who put chains round their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"necks and round mine with the rest; but, in the excess of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"courtesy, I held my peace and spake not a word; nor was this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,other but generosity on my part. They brought us into thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"presence, and thou gavest an order to smite the necks of the ten;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,yet did I not make myself known to thee and remained silent
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"before the Sworder, purely of my great generosity and courtesy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which led me to share with them in their death. But all my life
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"long have I dealt thus nobly with mankind, and they requite me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the foulest and evillest requital! When the Caliph heard my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,words and knew that I was a man of exceeding generosity and of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"very few words, one in whom is no forwardness (as this youth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would have it whom I rescued from mortal risk and who hath so
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"scurvily repaid me), he laughed with excessive laughter till he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell upon his back. Then said he to me, O Silent Man, do thy six"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brothers favour thee in wisdom and knowledge and spareness of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"speech? I replied, Never were they like me! Thou puttest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"reproach upon me, O Commander of the Faithful, and it becomes"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee not to even my brothers with me; for, of the abundance of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"their speech and their deficiency of courtesy and gravity, each"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"one of them hath gotten some maim or other. One is a monocular,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"another palsied, a third stone blind, a fourth cropped of ears"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and nose and a fifth shorn of both lips, while the sixth is a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hunchback and a cripple. And conceive not, O Commander of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Faithful, that I am prodigal of speech; but I must perforce"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,explain to thee that I am a man of greater worth and fewer words
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,than any of them. From each one of my brothers hangs a tale of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,how he came by his bodily defect and these I will relate to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee. So the Caliph gave ear to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Barber's Tale of his First Brother.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know then, O Commander of the Faithful, that my first brother, Al"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bakbuk, the Prattler, is a Hunchback who took to tailoring in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Baghdad, and he used to sew in a shop hired from a man of much"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wealth, who dwelt over the shop,[FN#635] and there was also a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"flour-mill in the basement. One day as my brother, the Hunchback,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was sitting in his shop a tailoring, he chanced to raise his head"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and saw a lady like the rising full moon at a balconied window of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his landlord's house, engaged in looking out at the passers"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"by.[FN#636] When my brother beheld her, his heart was taken with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,love of her and he passed his whole day gazing at her and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,neglected his tailoring till eventide. Next morning he opened his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shop and sat him down to sew; but, as often as he stitched a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stitch, he looked to the window and saw her as before; and his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,passion and infatuation for her increased. On the third day as he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was sitting in his usual place gazing on her, she caught sight of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him and, perceiving that he had been captivated with love of her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,laughed in his face[FN#637] and he smiled back at her. Then she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disappeared and presently sent her slave girl to him with a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bundle containing a piece of red cowered silk. The handmaid
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"accosted him and said, My lady salameth to thee and desireth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee, of thy skill and good will, to fashion for her a shift of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this piece and to sew it handsomely with thy best sewing. He
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, Hearkening and obedience; and shaped for her a chemise"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and finished sewing it the same day. When the morning morrowed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the girl came back and said to him, My lady salameth to thee and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,asks how thou hast passed yesternight; for she hath not tasted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sleep by reason of her heart being taken up with thee. Then she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"laid before him a piece of yellow satin and said, My lady biddeth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee cut her two pair of petticoat trousers out of this piece and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sew them this very day. Hearkening and obedience!' replied he,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"greet her for me with many greetings and say to her, Thy slave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is obedient to thine order; so command him as thou wilt. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,applied himself to cutting out and worked hard at sewing the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,trousers; and after an hour the lady appeared at the lattice and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saluted him by signs, now casting down her eyes, then smiling in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his face, and he began to assure himself that he would soon make"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a conquest. She did not let him stir till he had finished the two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pair of trousers, when she with drew and sent the handmaid to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whom he delivered them; and she took them and went her ways. When
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it was night, he threw himself on his carpet bed, and lay tossing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"about from side to side till morning, when he rose and sat down"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in his place. Presently the damsel came to him and said, My"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,master calleth for thee. Hearing these words he feared with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exceeding fear; but the slave girl, seeing his affright, said to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, No evil is meant to thee: naught but good awaiteth thee. My"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lady would have thee make acquaintance with my lord. So my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother the tailor, rejoicing with great joy, went with her; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when he came into the presence of his landlord, the lady's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"husband, he kissed the ground before him, and the master of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,house returned his greeting and gave him a great piece of linen
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, Shape me shirts out of this stuff and sew them well;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and my brother answered, To hear is to obey. Thereupon he fell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to work at once, snipping, shaping and sewing till he had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"finished twenty shirts by supper time, without stopping to taste"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"food. The house master asked him, How much the wage for this?;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he answered, Twenty dirhams. So the gentleman cried out to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the slave girl, Bring me twenty dirhams, and my brother spake"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not a word; but the lady signed, Take nothing from him;'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whereupon my brother said, By Allah I will take naught from thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hand. And he carried off his tailor's gear and returned to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shop, although he was destitute even to a red cent.[FN#638] Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he applied himself to do their work; eating, in his zeal and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"diligence, but a bit of bread and drinking only a little water"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for three days. At the end of this time came the handmaid and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to him, What hast thou done? Quoth he, They are"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"finished, and carried the shirts to the lady's husband, who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"would have paid him his hire: but he said, I will take nothing,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for fear of her and, returning to his shop, passed the night"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,without sleep because of his hunger. Now the dame had informed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her husband how the case stood (my brother knowing naught of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this); and the two had agreed to make him tailor for nothing, the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,better to mock and laugh at him. Next morning he went to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shop, and, as he sat there, the handmaid came to him and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Speak with my master. So he accompanied her to the husband who
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to him, I wish thee to cut out for me five long sleeved"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,robes.[FN#639] So he cut them out[FN#640] and took the stuff and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went away. Then he sewed them and carried them to the gentleman,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who praised his sewing and offered him a purse of silver. He put
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out his hand to take it, but the lady signed to him from behind"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her husband not to do so, and he replied, O my lord, there is no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hurry, we have time enough for this. Then he went forth from the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house meaner and meeker than a donkey, for verily five things"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"were gathered together in him viz.: love, beggary, hunger,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nakedness and hard labour. Nevertheless he heartened himself with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the hope of gaining the lady's favours. When he had made an end
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of all their jobs, they played him another trick and married him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to their slave girl; but, on the night when he thought to go in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to her, they said to him, Lie this night in the mill; and to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,morrow all will go well. My brother concluded that there was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,some good cause for this and nighted alone in the mill. Now the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,husband had set on the miller to make the tailor turn the mill:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so when night was half spent the man came in to him and began to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"say, This bull of ours hath be come useless and standeth still"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"instead of going round: he will not turn the mill this night, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yet we have great store of corn to be ground. However, I'll yoke"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him perforce and make him finish grinding it before morning, as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the folk are impatient for their flour. So he filled the hoppers
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with grain and, going up to my brother with a rope in his hand,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tied it round his neck and said to him, Gee up! Round with the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mill! thou, O bull, wouldst do nothing but grub and stale and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dung! Then he took a whip and laid it on the shoulders and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"calves of my brother, who began to howl and bellow; but none came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to help him; and he was forced to grind the wheat till hard upon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dawn, when the house master came in and, seeing my brother still"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tethered to the yoke and the man flogging him, went away. At day"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,break the miller returned home and left him still yoked and half
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dead; and soon after in came the slave girl who unbound him, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to him, I and my lady are right sorry for what hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,happened and we have borne thy grief with thee. But he had no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tongue wherewith to answer her from excess of beating and mill
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"turning. Then he retired to his lodging and behold, the clerk who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,had drawn up the marriage deed came to him[FN#641] and saluted
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, saying, Allah give thee long life! May thy espousal be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,blessed! This face telleth of pleasant doings and dalliance and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kissing and clipping from dusk to dawn. Allah grant the liar no
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"peace, O thou thousandfold cuckold!, my brother replied, by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Allah, I did nothing but turn the mill in the place of the bull"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all night till morning! Tell me thy tale, quoth he; and my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother recounted what had befallen him and he said, Thy star"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,agrees not with her star; but an thou wilt I can alter the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"contract for thee, adding, 'Ware lest another cheat be not in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"store for thee. And my brother answered him, See if thou have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,not another contrivance. Then the clerk left him and he sat in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his shop, looking for some one to bring him a job whereby he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,might earn his day's bread. Presently the handmaid came to him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, Speak with my lady. Begone, O my good girl, replied"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he, there shall be no more dealings between me and thy lady."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The handmaid returned to her mistress and told her what my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brother had said and presently she put her head out of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"window, weeping and saying, Why, O my beloved, are there to be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,no more dealings 'twixt me and thee? But he made her no answer.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then she wept and conjured him, swearing that all which had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,befallen him in the mill was not sanctioned by her and that she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was innocent of the whole matter. When he looked upon her beauty
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and loveliness and heard the sweetness of her speech, the sorrow"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which had possessed him passed from his heart; he accepted her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,excuse and he rejoiced in her sight. So he saluted her and talked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with her and sat tailoring awhile, after which the handmaid came"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to him and said, My mistress greeteth thee and informeth thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that her husband purposeth to lie abroad this night in the house
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of some intimate friends of his; so, when he is gone, do thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,come to us and spend the night with my lady in delightsomest
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"joyance till the morning. Now her husband had asked her, How"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shall we manage to turn him away from thee?; and she answered,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Leave me to play him another trick and make him a laughing stock
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for all the town. But my brother knew naught of the malice of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"women. As soon as it was dusk, the slave girl came to him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carried him to the house, and when the lady saw him she said to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, By Allah, O my lord, I have been longing exceedingly for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee. By Allah, cried he, kiss me quick before thou give me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"aught else.[FN#642] Hardly had he spoken, when the lady's"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"husband came in from the next room[FN#643] and seized him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"saying, By Allah, I will not let thee go, till I deliver thee to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the chief of the town watch. My brother humbled himself to him;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but he would not listen to him and carried him before the Prefect
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who gave him an hundred lashes with a whip and, mounting him on a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"camel, promenaded him round about the city, whilst the guards"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"proclaimed aloud, This is his reward who violateth the Harims of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"honourable men! Moreover, he fell off the camel and broke his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,leg and so became lame. Then the Prefect banished him from the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,city; and he went forth unknowing whither he should wend; but I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heard of him and fearing for him went out after him and brought
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him back secretly to the city and restored him to health and took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him into my house where he still liveth. The Caliph laughed at my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"story and said, Thou hast done well, O Samit, O Silent Man, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,spare of speech!; and he bade me take a present and go away. But
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I said, I will accept naught of thee except I tell thee what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,befell all my other brothers; and do not think me a man of many
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,words. So the Caliph gave ear to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Barber's Tale of his Second Brother.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Know, O Commander of the Faithful, that my second brother's name"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was Al-Haddar, that is the Babbler, and he was the paralytic. Now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it happened to him one day, as he was going about his business,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that an old woman accosted him and said, Stop a little, my good"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man, that I may tell thee of somewhat which, if it be to thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"liking, thou shalt do for me and I will pray Allah to give thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"good of it! My brother stopped and she went on, I will put thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in the way of a certain thing, so thou not be prodigal of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"speech. On with thy talk, quoth he; and she, What sayest thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to handsome quarters and a fair garden with flowing waters,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"flowers blooming, and fruit growing, and old wine going and a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pretty young face whose owner thou mayest embrace from dark till
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dawn? If thou do whatso I bid thee thou shalt see something
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,greatly to thy advantage. And is all this in the world? asked
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my brother; and she answered, Yes, and it shall be thine, so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou be reasonable and leave idle curiosity and many words, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"do my bidding. I will indeed, O my lady, said he, how is it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou hast preferred me in this matter before all men and what is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it that so much pleaseth thee in me? Quoth she, Did I not bid"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee be spare of speech? Hold thy peace and follow me. Know, that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the young lady, to whom I shall carry thee, loveth to have her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"own way and hateth being thwarted and all who gainsay; so, if"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou humour her, thou shalt come to thy desire of her. And my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother said, I will not cross her in anything. Then she went"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on and my brother followed her, an hungering after what she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"described to him till they entered a fine large house, handsome"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and choicely furnished, full of eunuchs and servants and showing"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,signs of prosperity from top to bottom. And she was carrying him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the upper story when the people of the house said to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"What dost thou here? But the old woman answered them, Hold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,your peace and trouble him not: he is a workman and we have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,occasion for him. Then she brought him into a fine great
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pavilion, with a garden in its midst, never eyes saw a fairer;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and made him sit upon a handsome couch. He had not sat long, be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fore he heard a loud noise and in came a troop of slave girls
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,surrounding a lady like the moon on the night of its fullest.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When he saw her, he rose up and made an obeisance to her,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whereupon she welcomed him and bade him be seated. So he sat down
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she said to him, Allah advance thee to honour! Is all well"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with thee? O my lady, he answered, all with me is right"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"well. Then she bade bring in food, and they set before her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"delicate viands; so she sat down to eat, making a show of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"affection to my brother and jesting with him, though all the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,while she could not refrain from laughing; but as often as he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"looked at her, she signed towards her handmaidens as though she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,were laughing at them. My brother (the ass!) understood nothing;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but, in the excess of his ridiculous passion, he fancied that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lady was in love with him and that she would soon grant him his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"desire. When they had done eating, they set on the wine and there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came in ten maidens like moons, with lutes ready strung in their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hands, and fell to singing with full voices, sweet and sad,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whereupon delight gat hold upon him and he took the cup from the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lady's hands and drank it standing. Then she drank a cup of wine
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and my brother (still standing) said to her Health, and bowed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to her. She handed him another cup and he drank it off, when she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slapped him hard on the nape of his neck.[FN#644] Upon this my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brother would have gone out of the house in anger; but the old
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,woman followed him and winked to him to return. So he came back
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the lady bade him sit and he sat down without a word. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,she again slapped him on the nape of his neck; and the second
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slapping did not suffice her, she must needs make all her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"handmaidens also slap and cuff him, while he kept saying to the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"old woman, I never saw aught nicer than this. She on her side"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ceased not exclaiming, Enough, enough, I conjure thee, O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mistress!; but the women slapped him till he well nigh swooned
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,away. Presently my brother rose and went out to obey a call of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"nature, but the old woman overtook him, and said, Be patient a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,little and thou shalt win to thy wish. How much longer have I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to wait, my brother replied, this slapping hath made me feel"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"faint. As soon as she is warm with wine, answered she, thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shalt have thy desire. So he returned to his place and sat down,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where upon all the handmaidens stood up and the lady bade them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,perfume him with pastiles and besprinkle his face with rose-
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"water. Then said she to him, Allah advance thee to honour! Thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hast entered my house and hast borne with my conditions, for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whoso thwarteth me I turn him away, and whoso is patient hath his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"desire. O mistress mine, said he, I am thy slave and in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hollow of thine hand! Know, then, continued she, that Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hath made me passionately fond of frolic; and whoso falleth in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with my humour cometh by whatso he wisheth. Then she ordered her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,maidens to sing with loud voices till the whole company was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"delighted; after which she said to one of them, Take thy lord,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and do what is needful for him and bring him back to me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forthright. So the damsel took my brother (and he not knowing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what she would do with him); but the old woman overtook him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, Be patient; there remaineth but little to do. At this his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,face brightened and he stood up before the lady while the old
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"woman kept saying, Be patient; thou wilt now at once win to thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wish!; till he said, Tell me what she would have the maiden do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with me? Nothing but good, replied she, as I am thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sacrifice! She wisheth only to dye thy eyebrows and pluck out thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mustachios. Quoth he, As for the dyeing of my eye brows, that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will come off with washing,[FN#645] but for the plucking out of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my mustachios, that indeed is a somewhat painful process. Be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cautious how thou cross her, cried the old woman; for she hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,set her heart on thee. So my brother patiently suffered her to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dye his eyebrows and pluck out his mustachios, after which the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,maiden returned to her mistress and told her. Quoth she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Remaineth now only one other thing to be done; thou must shave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his beard and make him a smooth o' face.[FN#646] So the maiden
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,went back and told him what her mistress had bidden her do; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my brother (the blockhead!) said to her, How shall I do what"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will disgrace me before the folk? But the old woman said, She"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,would do on this wise only that thou mayst be as a beardless
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,youth and that no hair be left on thy face to scratch and prick
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her delicate cheeks; for indeed she is passionately in love with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee. So be patient and thou shalt attain thine object. My
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brother was patient and did her bidding and let shave off his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beard and, when he was brought back to the lady, lo! he appeared"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dyed red as to his eyebrows, plucked of both mustachios, shorn of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his beard, rouged on both cheeks. At first she was affrighted at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him; then she made mockery of him and, laughing till she fell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"upon her back, said, O my lord, thou hast indeed won my heart by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy good nature! Then she conjured him, by her life, to stand up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and dance, and he arose, and capered about, and there was not a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cushion in the house but she threw it at his head, and in like"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,manner did all her women who also kept pelting him with oranges
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and lemons and citrons till he fell down senseless from the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cuffing on the nape of the neck, the pillowing and the fruit"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pelting. Now thou hast attained thy wish, said the old woman"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when he came round; there are no more blows in store for thee
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and there remaineth but one little thing to do. It is her wont,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when she is in her cups, to let no one have her until she put off"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her dress and trousers and remain stark naked.[FN#647] Then she
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will bid thee doff thy clothes and run; and she will run before
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee as if she were flying from thee; and do thou follow her from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"place to place till thy prickle stands at fullest point, when she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"will yield to thee;[FN#648] adding, Strip off thy clothes at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"once. So he rose, well nigh lost in ecstasy and, doffing his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"raiment, showed himself mother naked.--And Shahrazad perceived"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Thirty-second Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"old woman said to the Barber's second brother, Doff thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clothes, he rose, well nigh lost in ecstasy; and, stripping off"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his raiment, showed himself mother naked. Whereupon the lady"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stripped also and said to my brother, If thou want anything run"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after me till thou catch me. Then she set out at a run and he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ran after her while she rushed into room after room and rushed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out of room after room, my brother scampering after her in a rage"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of desire like a veritable madman, with yard standing terribly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tall. After much of this kind she dashed into a darkened place,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and he dashed after her; but suddenly he trod upon a yielding
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spot, which gave way under his weight; and, before he was aware"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"where he was, he found himself in the midst of a crowded market,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,part of the bazaar of the leather sellers who were crying the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,prices of skins and hides and buying and selling. When they saw
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him in his plight, naked, with standing yard, shorn of beard and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"mustachios, with eyebrows dyed red, and cheeks ruddied with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rouge, they shouted and clapped their hands at him, and set to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,flogging him with skins upon his bare body till a swoon came over
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him. Then they threw him on the back of an ass and carried him to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Chief of Police. Quoth the Chief, What is this? Quoth they,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,This fellow fell suddenly upon us out of the Wazir's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,house[FN#649] in this state. So the Prefect gave him an hundred
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lashes and then banished him from Baghdad. However I went out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after him and brought him back secretly into the city and made
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him a daily allowance for his living: although, were it not for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my generous humour, I could not have put up with the like of him."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then the Caliph gave ear to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Barber's Tale of his Third Brother.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"My third brother's name was Al-Fakík, the Gabbler, who was blind."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"One day Fate and Fortune drove him to a fine large house, and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"knocked at the door, desiring speech of its owner that he might"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beg somewhat of him. Quoth the master of the house, Who is at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the door? But my brother spake not a word and presently he heard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him repeat with a loud voice, Who is this? Still he made no"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,answer and immediately heard the master walk to the door and open
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it and say, What dost thou want? My brother answered Something"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for Allah Almighty's sake.[FN#650] Art thou blind? asked the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man, and my brother answered Yes. Quoth the other, Stretch me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out thy hand. So my brother put out his hand thinking that he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"would give him something; but he took it and, drawing him into"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the house, carried him up from stair to stair till they reached"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the terrace on the house top, my brother thinking the while that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he would surely give him something of food or money. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"asked my brother, What dost thou want, O blind man? and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered, Something for the Almighty's sake. Allah open for"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee some other door! O thou! why not say so when I was below
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stairs? O cadger, why not answer me when I first called to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee? And what meanest thou to do for me now? There is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,nothing in the house to give thee. Then take me down the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stair. The path is before thee. So my brother rose and made
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his way downstairs, till he came within twenty steps of the door,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,when his foot slipped and he rolled to the bottom and broke his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"head. Then he went out, unknowing whither to turn, and presently"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell in with two other blind men, companions of his, who said to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, What didst thou gain to day? He told them what had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befallen him and added, O my brothers, I wish to take some of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the money in my hands and provide myself with it. Now the master
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of the house had followed him and was listening to what they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,said; but neither my brother nor his comrades knew of this. So my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother went to his lodging and sat down to await his companions,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the house owner entered after him without being perceived.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When the other blind men arrived, my brother said to them, Bolt"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the door and search the house lest any stranger have followed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"us. The man, hearing this, caught hold of a cord that hung from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the ceiling and clung to it, whilst they went round about the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house and searched but found no one. So they came back, and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sitting beside my brother, brought out their money which they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,counted and lo! it was twelve thousand dirhams. Each took what he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wanted and they buried the rest in a corner of the room. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they set on food and sat down, to eat. Presently my brother,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hearing a strange pair of jaws munching by his side,[FN#651] said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to his friends, There is a stranger amongst us; and, putting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forth his hand, caught hold of that of the house master."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thereupon all fell on him and beat him;[FN#652] and when tired of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"belabouring him they shouted, O ye Moslems! a thief is come in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to us, seeking to take our money! A crowd gathered around them,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whereupon the intruder hung on to them; and complained with them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as they complained, and, shutting his eyes like them, so that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"none might doubt his blindness, cried out, O Moslems, I take"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"refuge with Allah and the Governor, for I have a matter to make"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"known to him! Suddenly up came the watch and, laying hands on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the whole lot (my brother being amongst them), drove them[FN#653]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the Governor's who set them before him and asked, What news"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with you? Quoth the intruder, Look and find out for thyself,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not a word shall be wrung from us save by torture, so begin by"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,beating me and after me beat this man our leader.[FN#654] And he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pointed to my brother. So they threw the man at full length and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gave him four hundred sticks on his backside. The beating pained
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, whereupon he opened one eye and, as they redoubled their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blows, he opened the other eye. When the Governor saw this he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to him, What have we here, O accursed?; whereto he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, Give me the seal-ring of pardon! We four have shammed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"blind, and we impose upon people that we may enter houses and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,look upon the unveiled faces of the women and contrive for their
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,corruption. In this way we have gotten great gain and our store
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"amounts to twelve thousand dirhams. Said I to my company, 'Give"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me my share, three thousand;' but they rose and beat me and took"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"away my money, and I seek refuge with Allah and with thee; better"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou have my share than they. So, if thou wouldst know the truth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of my words, beat one and every of the others more than thou hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beaten me, and he will surely open his eyes. The Governor gave"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"orders for the question to begin with my brother, and they bound"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him to the whipping post,[FN#655] and the Governor said, O scum"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the earth, do ye abuse the gracious gifts of Allah and make as"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"if ye were blind! Allah! Allah! cried my brother, by Allah,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there is none among us who can see. Then they beat him till he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"swooned away and the Governor cried, Leave him till he come to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and then beat him again. After this he caused each of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"companions to receive more than three hundred sticks, whilst the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,sham Abraham kept saying to them Open your eyes or you will be
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beaten afresh. At last the man said to the Governor, Dispatch"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,some one with me to bring thee the money; for these fellows will
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not open their eyes, lest they incur disgrace before the folk."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So the Governor sent to fetch the money and gave the man his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pretended share, three thousand dirhams; and, keeping the rest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for himself, banished the three blind men from the city. But I, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Commander of the Faithful, went out and overtaking my brother"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,questioned him of his case; whereupon he told me of what I have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"told thee; so I brought him secretly into the city, and appointed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him (in the strictest privacy) an allowance for meat and drink!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The Caliph laughed at my story and said, Give him a gift and let"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him go; but I said, By Allah! I will take naught till I have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,made known to the Commander of the Faithful what came to pass
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with the rest of my brothers; for truly I am a man of few words
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and spare of speech. Then the Caliph gave ear to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Barber's Tale of his Fourth Brother.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now as for my fourth brother, O Commander of the Faithful, Al-Kuz"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"al-aswáni, or the long necked Gugglet hight, from his brimming"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"over with words, the same who was blind of one eye, he became a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,butcher in Baghdad and he sold flesh and fattened rams; and great
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"men and rich bought their meat of him, so that he amassed much"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wealth and got him cattle and houses. He fared thus a long while,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"till one day, as he was sitting in his shop, there came up an old"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man and long o' the beard, who laid down some silver and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Give me meat for this. He gave him his money s worth of flesh
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and the oldster went his ways. My brother examined the Shaykh's
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"silver, and, seeing that the dirhams were white and bright, he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,set them in a place apart. The greybeard continued to return to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the shop regularly for five months, and my brother ceased not to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lay up all the coin he received from him in its own box. At last
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he thought to take out the money to buy sheep; so he opened the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"box and found in it nothing, save bits of white paper cut round"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to look like coin;[FN#656] so he buffeted his face and cried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"aloud till the folk gathered about him, whereupon he told them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his tale which made them marvel exceedingly. Then he rose as was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his wont, and slaughtering a ram hung it up inside his shop;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after which he cut off some of the flesh, and hanging it outside"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"kept saying to himself, O Allah, would the ill omened old fellow"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but come! And an hour had not passed before the Shaykh came with
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his silver in hand; where upon my brother rose and caught hold of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him calling out, Come aid me, O Moslems, and learn my story with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this villain! When the old man heard this, he quietly said to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him, Which will be the better for thee, to let go of me or to be"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,disgraced by me amidst the folk? In what wilt thou disgrace
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me? In that thou sellest man's flesh for mutton! Thou liest,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou accursed! Nay, he is the accursed who hath a man hanging"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"up by way of meat in his shop. If the matter be as thou sayest, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,give thee lawful leave to take my money and my life. Then the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"old man cried out aloud, Ho, ye people! if you would prove the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"truth of my words, enter this man's shop. The folk rushed in and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,found that the ram was become a dead man[FN#657] hung up for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sale. So they set upon my brother crying out, O Infidel! O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,villain!; and his best friends fell to cuffing and kicking him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and kept saying, Dost thou make us eat flesh of the sons of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Adam? Furthermore, the old man struck him on the eye and put it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"out. Then they carried the carcass, with the throat cut, before"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Chief of the city watch, to whom the old man said, O Emir,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this fellow butchers men and sells their flesh for mutton and we
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have brought him to thee; so arise and execute the judgments of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Allah (to whom be honour and glory!). My brother would have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"defended himself, but the Chief refused to hear him and sentenced"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him to receive five hundred sticks and to forfeit the whole of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his property. And, indeed, had it not been for that same property"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which he expended in bribes, they would have surely slain him."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then the Chief banished him from Baghdad; and my brother fared
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"forth at a venture, till he came to a great town, where he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thought it best to set up as a cobbler; so he opened a shop and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sat there doing what he could for his livelihood. One day, as he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"went forth on his business, he heard the distant tramp of horses"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, asking the cause, was told that the King was going out to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hunt and course; so my brother stopped to look at the fine suite.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,It so fortuned that the King's eye met my brother's; whereupon
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the King hung down his head and said, I seek refuge with Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from the evil of this day!;[FN#658] and turned the reins of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,steed and returned home with all his retinue. Then he gave orders
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to his guards, who seized my brother and beat him with a beating"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,so painful that he was well nigh dead; and my brother knew not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what could be the cause of his maltreatment, after which he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,returned to his place in sorriest plight. Soon afterwards he went
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to one of the King's household and related what had happened to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him; and the man laughed till he fell upon his back and cried, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother mine, know that the King cannot bear to look at a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"monocular, especially if he be blind of the right eye, in which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,case he doth not let him go without killing him. When my brother
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard this, he resolved to fly from that city; so he went forth"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from it to another wherein none knew him and there he abode a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"long while. One day, being full of sorrowful thought for what had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"befallen him, he sallied out to solace himself; and, as he was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"walking along, he heard the distant tramp of horses behind him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said, The judgement of Allah is upon me! and looked about"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for a hiding place but found none. At last he saw a closed door
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which he pushed hard: it yielded. and he entered a long gallery
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in which he took refuge, but hardly had he done so, when two men"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"set upon him crying out, Allah be thanked for having delivered"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee into our hands, O enemy of God! These three nights thou hast"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"robbed us of our rest and sleep, and verily thou hast made us"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"taste of the death cup. My brother asked, O folk, what ails"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"you?; and they answered, Thou givest us the change and goest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,about to disgrace us and plannest some plot to cut the throat of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the house master! Is it not enough that thou hast brought him to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beggary, thou and thy fellows? But now give us up the knife"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wherewith thou threatenest us every night. Then they searched
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him and found in his waist belt the knife used for his shoe
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leather; and he said, O people, have the fear of Allah before"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"your eyes and maltreat me not, for know that my story is a right"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,strange! And what is thy story? said they: so he told them
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what had befallen him, hoping they would let him go; however they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"paid no heed to what he said and, instead of showing some regard,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beat him grievously and tore off his clothes: then, finding on"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his sides the scars of beating with rods, they said, O accursed!"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,these marks are the manifest signs of thy guilt! They carried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him before the Governor, whilst he said to himself, I am now"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,punished for my sins and none can deliver me save Allah
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Almighty! The Governor addressing my brother asked him, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"villain, what led thee to enter their house with intention to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"murther?; and my brother answered, I conjure thee by Allah, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Emir, hear my words and be not hasty in condemning me! But the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Governor cried, Shall we listen to the words of a robber who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hath beggared these people, and who beareth on his back the scar"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of his stripes? adding, They surely had not done this to thee,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,save for some great crime. So he sentenced him to receive an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hundred cuts with the scourge, after which they set him on a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"camel and paraded him about the city, proclaiming, This is the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,requital and only too little to requite him who breaketh into
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"people's houses. Then they thrust him out of the city, and my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother wandered at random, till I heard what had befallen him;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, going in search of him, questioned him of his case; so he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"acquainted me with his story and all his mischances, and I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,carried him secretly to the city where I made him an allowance
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for his meat and drink. Then the Caliph gave ear to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Barber's Tale of his Fifth Brother.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"My fifth brother, Al-Nashshár,[FN#659] the Babbler, the same who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was cropped of both ears, O Commander of the Faithful, was an"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,asker wont to beg of folk by night and live on their alms by day.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Now when our father, who was an old man well stricken in years"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sickened and died, he left us seven hundred dirhams whereof each"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"son took his hundred; but, as my fifth brother received his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"portion, he was perplexed and knew not what to do with it. While"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in this uncertainty he bethought him to lay it out on glass ware
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of all sorts and turn an honest penny on its price. So he bought
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"an hundred dirhams worth of verroterie and, putting it into a big"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"tray, sat down to sell it on a bench at the foot of a wall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,against which he leant back. As he sat with the tray before him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he fell to musing and said to himself, Know, O my good Self,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that the head of my wealth, my principal invested in this glass"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ware, is an hundred dirhams. I will assuredly sell it for two"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hundred with which I will forthright buy other glass and make by
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"it four hundred; nor will I cease to sell and buy on this wise,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till I have gotten four thousand and soon find myself the master
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of much money. With these coins I will buy merchandise and jewels
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and ottars[FN#660] and gain great profit on them; till, Allah"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"willing, I will make my capital an hundred thousand dirhams. Then"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I will purchase a fine house with white slaves and eunuchs and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,horses; and I will eat and drink and disport myself; nor will I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"leave a singing man or a singing woman in the city, but I will"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,summon them to my palace and make them perform before me. All
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this he counted over in his mind, while the tray of glass ware,:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"worth an hundred dirhams, stood on the bench before him, and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"after looking at it, he continued, And when, Inshallah! my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"capital shall have become one hundred thousand[FN#661] dinars, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will send out marriage brokeresses to require for me in wedlock
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the daughters of Kings and Wazirs; and I will demand to wife the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eldest daughter of the Prime Minister; for it hath reached me
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,that she is perfect in beauty and prime in loveliness and rare in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,accomplishments. I will give a marriage settlement of one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thousand dinars; and, if her father consent, well: but if not I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will take her by force from under his very nose. When she is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"safely homed in my house, I will buy ten little eunuchs[FN#662]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and for myself a robe of the robes of Kings and Sultans; and get
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me a saddle of gold and a bridle set thick with gems of price.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then I will mount with the Mamelukes preceding me and surrounding
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me, and I will make the round of the city whilst the folk salute"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me and bless me; after which I will repair to the Wazir (he that
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is father of the girl) with armed white slaves before and behind
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"me and on my right and on my left. When he sees me, the Wazir"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"stands up, and seating me in his own place sits down much below"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,me; for that I am to be his son in law. Now I have with me two
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"eunuchs carrying purses, each containing a thousand dinars; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of these I deliver to him the thousand, his daughter's marriage"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"settlement, and make him a free gift of the other thousand, that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he may have reason to know my generosity and liberality and my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,greatness of spirit and the littleness of the world in my eyes.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And for ten words he addresses to me I answer him two. Then back
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I go to my house, and if one come to me on the bride's part, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,make him a present of money and throw on him a dress of honour;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but if he bring me a gift, I give it back to him and refuse to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"accept it,[FN#663] that they may learn what a proud spirit is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mine which never condescends to derogate. Thus I establish my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rank and status. When this is done I appoint her wedding night
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and adorn my house showily! gloriously! And as the time for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"parading the bride is come, I don my finest attire and sit down"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on a mattress of gold brocade, propping up my elbow with a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"pillow, and turning neither to the right nor to the left; but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,looking only straight in front for the haughtiness of my mind and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the gravity of my understanding. And there before me stands my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wife in her raiment and ornaments, lovely as the full moon; and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I, in my loftiness and dread lordliness,[FN#664] will not glance"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at her till those present say to me, 'O our lord and our master,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy wife, thy handmaid, standeth before thee; vouchsafe her one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"look, for standing wearieth her.' Then they kiss the ground"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before me many times; whereupon I raise my eyes and cast at her
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,one single glance and turn my face earthwards again. Then they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bear her off to the bride chamber,[FN#665] and I arise and change"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my clothes for a far finer suit; and, when they bring in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bride a second time, I deign not to throw her a look till they"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have begged me many times; after which I glance at her out of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"corner of one eye, and then bend down my head. I continue acting"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after this fashion till the parading and displaying are
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,completed[FN#666]--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,ceased saying her per misted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When It was the Thirty-third Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Barber's fifth brother proceeded: - Then I bend down my head and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,continue acting after this fashion till her parading and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,displaying are completed. Thereupon I order one of my eunuchs to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bring me a bag of five hundred dinars which I give as largesse to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the tire women present and bid them one and all lead me to the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,bride chamber. When they leave me alone with her I neither look
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at her nor speak to her, but lie[FN#667] by her side with my face"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the wall showing my contempt, that each and every may again"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,remark how high and haughty I am. Presently her mother comes in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to me, and kissing[FN#668] my head and hand, says to me, 'O my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"lord, look upon thine handmaid who longs for thy favour; so heal"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,her broken spirit!' I give her no answer; and when she sees this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she rises and busses my feet many times and says, 'O my lord, in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"very sooth my daughter is a beautiful maid, who hath never known"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"man; and if thou show her this backwardness and aversion, her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heart will break; so do thou incline to her and speak to her and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,soothe her mind and spirit.' Then she rises and fetches a cup of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wine; and says to her daughter, 'Take it and hand it to thy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lord.' But as e approaches me I leave her standing between my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hands and sit, propping my elbow on a round cushion purfled with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gold thread, leaning lazily back, and without looking at her in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the majesty of my spirit, so that she may deem me indeed a Sultan"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and a mighty man. Then she says to me, 'O my lord, Allah upon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thee, do not refuse to take the cup from the hand of thine hand"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"maid, for verily I am thy bondswoman.' But I do not speak to her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and she presses me, saying, 'There is no help but that thou drink"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it;' and she puts it to my lips. Then I shake my fist in her face
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and kick her with my foot thus. So he let out with his toe an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"knocked over the tray of glass ware which fell to the ground and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"falling from the bench, all that was on it was broken to bits. 'O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"foulest of pimps,[FN#669] this comes from the pride of my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"spirit' cried my brother; and then, O Commander of the Faithful,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he buffeted his face and rent his garments and kept on weeping
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and beating himself. The folk who were flocking to their Friday
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"prayers saw him; and some of them looked at him and pitied him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whilst others paid no heed to him, and in this way my bother lost"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"both capital and profit. He remained weeping a long while, and at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"last up came a beautiful lady, the scent of musk exhaling from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her, who was going to Friday prayers riding a mule with a gold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,saddle and followed by several eunuchs. When she saw the broken
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"glass and my brother weeping, her kind heart was moved to pity"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for him, and she asked what ailed him and was told that he had a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tray full of glass ware by the sale of which he hoped to gain his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"living, but it was broken, and (said they), there befell him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,what thou seest. Thereupon she called up one of her eunuchs and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said to him, Give what thou hast with thee to this poor fellow!."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And he gave my brother a purse in which he found five hundred
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dinars; and when it touched his hand he was well nigh dying for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,excess of joy and he offered up blessings for her. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned to his abode a substantial man; and, as he sat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"considering, some one rapped at the door. So he rose and opened"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and saw an old woman whom he had never seen. O my son, said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she, know that prayer tide is near and I have not yet made my"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Wuzu-ablution;[FN#670] so kindly allow me the use of thy lodging
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"for the purpose. My brother answered, To hear is to comply;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and going in bade her follow him. So she entered and he brought
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her an ewer wherewith to wash, and sat down like to fly with joy"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,because of the dinars which he had tied up in his belt for a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"purse. When the old woman had made an end of her ablution, she"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came up to where he sat, and prayed a two bow prayer; after which"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"she blessed my brother with a godly benediction, and he while"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thanking her put his hand to the dinars and gave her two, saying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to himself These are my voluntaries.[FN#671] When she saw the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gold she cried, Praise be to Allah! why dost thou look on one"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,who loveth thee as if she were a beggar? Take back thy money: I
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have no need of it; or, if thou want it not, return it to her who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"gave it thee when thy glass ware was broken. Moreover, if thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wish to be united with her, I can manage the matter, for she is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my mistress. O my mother, asked my brother, by what manner of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"means can I get at her?; and she answered, O my son! she hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"an inclination for thee, but she is the wife of a wealthy man; so"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"take the whole of thy money with thee and follow me, that I may"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,guide thee to thy desire: and when thou art in her company spare
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"neither persuasion nor fair words, but bring them all to bear"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,upon her; so shalt thou enjoy her beauty and wealth to thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,heart's content. My brother took all his gold and rose and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"followed the old woman, hardly believing in his luck. She ceased"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not faring on, and my brother following her, till they came to a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,tall gate at which she knocked and a Roumi slave-girl[FN#672]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came out and opened to them. Then the old woman led my brother
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,into a great sitting room spread with wondrous fine carpets and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hung with curtains, where he sat down with his gold before him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and his turband on his knee.[FN#673] He had scarcely taken seat
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,before there came to him a young lady (never eye saw fairer) clad
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in garments of the most sumptuous; whereupon my brother rose to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his feet, and she smiled in his face and welcomed him, signing to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him to be seated. Then she bade shut the door and, when it was"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shut, she turned to my brother, and taking his hand conducted him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to a private chamber furnished with various kinds of brocades and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,gold cloths. Here he sat down and she sat by his side and toyed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with him awhile; after which she rose and saying, Stir not from"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy seat till I come back to thee; disappeared. Meanwhile as he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was on this wise, lo! there came in to him a black slave big of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"body and bulk and holding a drawn sword in hand, who said to him,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Woe to thee! Who brought thee hither and what dost thou want
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"here? My brother could not return him a reply, being tongue tied"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,for terror; so the blackamoor seized him and stripped him of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,clothes and bashed him with the flat of his sword blade till he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fell to the ground, swooning from excess of belabouring. The ill"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,omened nigger fancied that there was an end of him and my brother
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard him cry, Where is the salt wench?[FN#674] Where upon in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came a handmaid holding in hand a large tray of salt, and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slave kept rubbing it into my brother's wounds;[FN#675] but he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,did not stir fearing lest the slave might find out that he was
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"not dead and kill him outright. Then the salt girl went away, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the slave cried Where is the souterrain[FN#676] guardianess?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hereupon in came the old woman and dragged my brother by his feet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to a souterrain and threw him down upon a heap of dead bodies. In
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this place he lay two full days, but Allah made the salt the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,means of preserving his life by staunching the blood and staying
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"its flow Presently, feeling himself able to move, Al-Nashshar"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rose and opened the trap door in fear and trembling and crept out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"into the open; and Allah protected him, so that he went on in the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"darkness and hid himself in the vestibule till dawn, when he saw"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the accursed beldam sally forth in quest of other quarry. He
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"followed in her wake without her knowing it, and made for his own"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lodging where he dressed his wounds and medicined himself till he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"was whole. Meanwhile he used to watch the old woman, tracking her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"at all times and seasons, and saw her accost one man after"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,another and carry them to the house. However he uttered not a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"word; but, as soon as he waxed hale and hearty, he took a piece"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of stuff and made it into a bag which he filled with broken glass
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and bound about his middle. He also disguised himself as a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Persian that none might know him, and hid a sword under his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"clothes of foreign cut. Then he went out and presently, falling"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in with the old woman, said to her, speaking Arabic with a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Persian accent, Venerable lady,[FN#677] I am a stranger arrived"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,but this day here where I know no one. Hast thou a pair of scales
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wherein I may weigh eleven hundred dinars? I will give thee
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"somewhat of them for thy pains. I have a son, a money changer,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who keepeth all kinds of scales, she answered, so come with me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to him before he goeth out and he will weigh thy gold. My
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brother answered Lead the way! She led him to the house and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"young lady herself came out and opened it, whereupon the old"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"woman smiled in her face and said, I bring thee fat meat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"today.[FN#678] Then the damsel took my brother by the hand, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,led him to the same chamber as before; where she sat with him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"awhile then rose and went forth saying, Stir not from thy seat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till I come back to thee. Presently in came the accursed slave
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"with the drawn sword and cried to my brother, Up and be damned"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to thee. So he rose, and as the slave walked on before him he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"drew the sword from under his clothes and smote him with it,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,making head fly from body. Then he dragged the corpse by the feet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to the souterrain and called out, Where is the salt wench? Up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"came the girl carrying the tray of salt and, seeing my brother"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sword in hand, turned to fly; but he followed her and struck off"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"her head. Then he called out, Where is the souterrain"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"guardianess? , and in came the old woman to whom he said, Dost"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"know me again, ill omened hag? No my lord, she replied, and he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"said, I am the owner of the five hundred gold pieces, whose"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house thou enteredst to make the ablution and to pray, and whom"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou didst snare hither and betray. Fear Allah and spare me,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,cried she; but he regarded her not and struck her with the sword
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till he had cut her in four. Then he went to look for the young
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,lady; and when she saw him her reason fled and she cried out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"piteously Aman![FN#679] Mercy! So he spared her and asked,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"What made thee consort with this blackamoor?, and she answered,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I was slave to a certain merchant, and the old woman used to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"visit me till I took a liking to her. One day she said to me, 'We"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have a marriage festival at our house the like of which was never
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seen and I wish thee to enjoy the sight.' 'To hear is to obey,'"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered I, and rising arrayed myself in my finest raiment and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ornaments, and took with me a purse containing an hundred gold"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pieces. Then she brought me hither and hardly had I entered the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"house when the black seized on me, and I have remained in this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,case three whole years through the perfidy of the accursed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beldam. Then my brother asked her, Is there anything of his in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the house?; whereto she answered, Great store of wealth, and if"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou art able to carry it away, do so and Allah give thee good of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,it My brother went with her and she opened to him sundry chests
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wherein were money bags, at which he was astounded; then she said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to him, Go now and leave me here, and fetch men to remove the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"money., He went out and hired ten men, but when he returned he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"found the door wide open, the damsel gone and nothing left but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,some small matter of coin and the household stuffs.[FN#680] By
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this he knew that the girl had overreached him; so he opened the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"store rooms and seized what was in them, together with the rest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the money, leaving nothing in the house. He passed the night"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"rejoicing, but when morning dawned he found at the door some"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"twenty troopers who laid hands on him saying, The Governor wants"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee! My brother implored them hard to let him return to his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,house; and even offered them a large sum of money; but they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"refused and, binding him fast with cords, carried him off. On the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,way they met a friend of my brother who clung to his skirt and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"implored his protection, begging him to stand by him and help to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deliver him out of their hands. The man stopped, and asked them"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"what was the matter, and they answered, The Governor hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"ordered us to bring this fellow before him and, look ye, we are"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"doing so. My brother's friend urged them to release him, and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"offered them five hundred dinars to let him go, saying, When ye"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,return to the Governor tell him that you were unable to find
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"him. But they would not listen to his words and took my brother,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"dragging him along on his face, and set him before the Governor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"who asked him, Whence gottest thou these stuffs and monies?;"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he answered, I pray for mercy! So the Governor gave him the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,kerchief of mercy;[FN#681] and he told him all that had befallen
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,him from first to last with the old woman and the flight of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"damsel; ending with, Whatso I have taken, take of it what thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wilt, so thou leave me sufficient to support life.[FN#682] But"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Governor took the whole of the stuffs and all the money for
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"himself; and, fearing lest the affair come to the Sultan's ears,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he summoned my brother and said, Depart from this city, else I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,will hang thee. Hearing and obedience quoth my brother and set
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,out for another town. On the way thieves fell foul of him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,stripped and beat him and docked his ears; but I heard tidings of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,his misfortunes and went out after him taking him clothes; and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,brought him secretly into the city where I assigned to him an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,allowance for meat and drink. And presently the Caliph gave ear
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The Barber's Tale of his Sixth Brother.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"My sixth brother, O Commander of the Faithful, Shakashik,[FN#683]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"or Many clamours, the shorn of both lips, was once rich and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"became poor, so one day he went out to beg somewhat to keep life"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in him. As he was on the road he suddenly caught sight of a large
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and handsome mansion, with a detached building wide and lofty at"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the entrance, where sat sundry eunuchs bidding and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forbidding.[FN#684] My brother enquired of one of those idling
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,there and he replied The palace belongs to a scion of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Barmaki house; so he stepped up to the door keepers and asked an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"alms of them Enter, said they, by the great gate and thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,shalt get what thou seekest from the Wazir our master.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Accordingly he went in and, passing through the outer entrance,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,walked on a while and presently came to a mansion of the utmost
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"beauty and elegance, paved with marble, hung with curtains and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,having in the midst of it a flower garden whose like he had never
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,seen.[FN#685] My brother stood awhile as one bewildered not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"knowing whither to turn his steps; then, seeing the farther end"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the sitting chamber tenanted, he walked up to it and there"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,found a man of handsome presence and comely beard. When this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,personage saw my brother he stood up to him and welcomed him and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,asked him of his case; whereto he replied that he was in want and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,needed charity. Hearing these words the grandee showed great
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"concern and, putting his hand to his fine robe, rent it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"exclaiming, What! am I in a City, and thou here an hungered? I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have not patience to bear such disgrace! Then he promised him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all manner of good cheer and said, There is no help but that"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thou stay with me and eat of my salt.[FN#686] O my lord,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"answered my brother, I can wait no longer; for I am indeed dying"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of hunger. So he cried, Ho boy! bring basin and ewer; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"turning to my brother, said, O my guest come forward and wash"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thy hands. My brother rose to do so but he saw neither ewer nor
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,basin; yet his host kept washing his hands with invisible soap in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"imperceptible water and cried, Bring the table! But my brother"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"again saw nothing. Then said the host, Honour me by eating of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this meat and be not ashamed. And he kept moving his hand to and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"fro as if he ate and saying to my brother, I wonder to see thee"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eating thus sparely: do not stint thyself for I am sure thou art
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,famished. So my brother began to make as though he were eating
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"whilst his host kept saying to him, Fall to, and note especially"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the excellence of this bread and its whiteness! But still my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother saw nothing. Then said he to himself, This man is fond"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of poking fun at people; and replied, O my lord, in all my days"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I never knew aught more winsome than its whiteness or sweeter
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"than its savour. The Barmecide said, This bread was baked by a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hand maid of mine whom I bought for five hundred dinars. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"called out, Ho boy, bring in the meat pudding[FN#687] for our"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"first dish, and let there be plenty of fat in it; and, turning"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to my brother said, O my guest, Allah upon thee, hast ever seen"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"anything better than this meat pudding? Now by my life, eat and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be not abashed. Presently he cried out again, Ho boy, serve up"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the marinated stew[FN#688] with the fatted sand grouse in it;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he said to my brother, Up and eat, O my guest, for truly"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thou art hungry and needest food. So my brother began wagging
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"his jaws and made as if champing and chewing,[FN#689] whilst the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,host continued calling for one dish after another and yet
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"produced nothing save orders to eat. Presently he cried out, Ho"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"boy, bring us the chickens stuffed with pistachio nuts; and said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"to my brother, By thy life, O my guest, I have fattened these"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"chickens upon pistachios; eat, for thou hast never eaten their"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"like. O my lord, replied my brother, they are indeed first"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,rate. Then the host began motioning with his hand as though he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,were giving my brother a mouthful; and ceased not to enumerate
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and expatiate upon the various dishes to the hungry man whose
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"hunger waxt still more violent, so that his soul lusted after a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bit of bread, even a barley scone.[FN#690] Quoth the Barmecide,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Didst thou ever taste anything more delicious than the seasoning
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of these dishes?; and quoth my brother, Never, O my lord! Eat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heartily and be not ashamed, said the host, and the guest, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"have eaten my fill of meat; So the entertainer cried, Take away"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and bring in the sweets; and turning to my brother said, Eat of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this almond conserve for it is prime and of these honey fritters;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"take this one, by my life, the syrup runs out of it. May I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"never be bereaved of thee, O my lord, replied the hungry one and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,began to ask him about the abundance of musk in the fritters.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Such is my custom, he answered: they put me a dinar weight of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,musk in every honey fritter and half that quantity of ambergris.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,All this time my brother kept wagging head and jaws till the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"master cried, Enough of this. Bring us the dessert! Then said"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he to him,' Eat of these almonds and walnuts and raisins; and of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this and that (naming divers kinds of dried fruits), and be not"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"abashed. But my brother replied, O my lord, indeed I am full: I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"can eat no more. O my guest, repeated the host, if thou have"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a mind to these good things eat: Allah! Allah![FN#691] do not
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"remain hungry; but my brother rejoined, O my lord, he who hath"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,eaten of all these dishes how can he be hungry? Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"considered and said to himself, I will do that shall make him"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,repent of these pranks. Presently the entertainer called out
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bring me the wine; and, moving his hands in the air, as though"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"they had set it before them, he gave my brother a cup and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Take this cup and, if it please thee, let me know. O my lord,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he replied, it is notable good as to nose but I am wont to drink"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"wine some twenty years old. Knock then at this door,[FN#692]"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,quoth the host for thou canst not drink of aught better. By
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy kindness, said my brother, motioning with his hand as though"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he were drinking. Health and joy to thee, exclaimed the house"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,master and feigned to fill a cup and drink it off; then he handed
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,another to my brother who quaffed it and made as if he were
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"drunken. Presently he took the host unawares; and, raising his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"arm till the white of his armpit appeared, dealt him such a cuff"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,on the nape of his neck that the palace echoed to it. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,came down upon him with a second cuff and the entertainer cried
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"aloud What is this, O thou scum of the earth? O my lord,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied my brother, thou hast shown much kindness to thy slave,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and admitted him into thine abode and given him to eat of thy
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,victual; then thou madest him drink of thine old wine till he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,became drunken and boisterous; but thou art too noble not to bear
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,with his ignorance and pardon his offence. When the Barmaki
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"heard my brother's words he laughed his loudest and said, Long"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have I been wont to make mock of men and play the madcap among my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"intimates, but never yet have I come across a single one who had"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the patience and the wit to enter into all my humours save
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thyself: so I forgive thee, and thou shalt be my boon companion"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,in very sooth and never leave me. Then he ordered the servants
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to lay the table in earnest and they set on all the dishes of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,which he had spoken in sport; and he and my brother ate till they
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"were satisfied; after which they removed to the drinking chamber,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,where they found damsels like moons who sang all manner songs and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,played on all manner instruments. There they remained drinking
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,till their wine got the better of them and the host treated my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother like a familiar friend, so that he became as it were his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother, and bestowed on him a robe of honour and loved him with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,exceeding love. Next morning the two fell again to feasting and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"carousing, and ceased not to lead this life for a term of twenty"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,years; at the end of which the Barmecide died and the Sultan took
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,possession of all his wealth and squeezed my brother of his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"savings, till he was left a pauper without a penny to handle. So"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,he quitted the city and fled forth following his face;[FN#693]
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"but, when he was half way between two towns, the wild Arabs fell"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"on him and bound him and carried him to their camp, where his"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"captor proceeded to torture him, saying, Buy thy life of me with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"thy money, else I will slay thee! My brother began to weep and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"replied, By Allah, I have nothing, neither gold nor silver; but"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I am thy prisoner; so do with me what thou wilt. Then the Badawi
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"drew a knife, broad bladed and so sharp grinded that if plunged"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,into a camel's throat it would sever it clean across from one
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"jugular to the other,[FN#694] and cut off my brother's lips and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,waxed more instant in requiring money. Now this Badawi had a fair
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wife who in her husband's absence used to make advances to my
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"brother and offer him her favours, but he held off from her. One"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,day she began to tempt him as usual and he played with her and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made her sit on his lap, when behold, in came the Badawi who,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"seeing this, cried out, Woe to thee, O accursed villain,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wouldest thou debauch my wife for me? Then he took out a knife
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and cut off my brother's yard, after which he bound him on the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"back of a camel and, carrying him to a mountain, left him there."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,He was at last found by some who recognised him and gave him meat
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and drink and acquainted me with his condition; whereupon I went
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forth to him and brought him back to Baghdad where I made him an
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"allowance sufficient to live on. This, then, O Commander of the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Faithful, is the history of my six brothers, and I feared to go"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,away without relating it all to thee and leave thee in the error
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of judging me to be like them. And now thou knowest that I have
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"six brothers upon my hands and, being more upright than they, I"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,support the whole family. When the Caliph heard my story and all
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"I told him concerning my brothers, he laughed and said, Thou"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sayest sooth, O Silent Man! thou art indeed spare of speech nor"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is there aught of forwardness in thee; but now go forth out of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,this city and settle in some other. And he banished me under
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,edict. I left Baghdad and travelled in foreign parts till I heard
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of his death and the accession of another to the Caliphate. Then
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I returned to Baghdad where I found all my brothers dead and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"chanced upon this young man, to whom I rendered the kindliest"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"service, for without me he had surely been killed. Indeed he"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,slanders me and accuses me of a fault which is not in my nature;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and what he reports concerning impudence and meddling and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,forwardness is idle and false; for verily on his account I left
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Baghdad and travelled about full many a country till I came to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"this city and met him here in your company. And was not this, O"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"worthy assemblage, of the generosity of my nature?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,The End of the Tailor's Tale.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then quoth the Tailor to the King of China: When we heard the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Barber's tale and saw the excess of his loquacity and the way in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"which he had wronged this young man, we laid hands on him and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"shut him up, after which we sat down in peace, and ate and drank"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and enjoyed the good things of the marriage feast till the time
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of the call to mid afternoon prayer, when I left the party and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"returned home. My wife received me with sour looks and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Thou goest a pleasuring among thy friends and thou leavest me to
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"sit sorrowing here alone. So now, unless thou take me abroad and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"let me have some amusement for the rest of the day, I will cut"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the rope[FN#695] and it will be the cause of my separation from
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,thee. So I took her out and we amused ourselves till supper
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"time, when we returned home and fell in with this Hunchback who"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was brimful of drink and trolling out these rhymes:
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Clear's the wine, the cup's fine;   * Like to like they combine:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,It is wine and not cup!              * 'Tis a cup and not wine!
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,So I invited him to sup with us and went out to buy fried fish;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,after which we sat down to eat; and presently my wife took a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,piece of bread and a fid of fish and stuffed them into his mouth
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and he choked; and, though I slapped him long and hard between"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the shoulders, he died. Then I carried him off and contrived to"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"throw him into the house of this leach, the Jew; and the leach"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,contrived to throw him into the house of the Reeve; and the Reeve
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"contrived to throw him on the way of the Nazarene broker. This,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"then, is my adventure which befell me but yesterday. Is not it"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,more wondrous than the story of the Hunchback? When the King of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,China heard the Tailor's tale he shook his head for pleasure;
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and, showing great surprise, said, This that passed between the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,young man and the busy-body of a Barber is indeed more pleasant
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and wonderful than the story of my lying knave of a Hunchback.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Then he bade one of his Chamberlains go with the Tailor and bring
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the Barber out of jail, saying, I wish to hear the talk of this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Silent Man and it shall be the cause of your deliverance one and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"all: then we will bury the Hunchback, for that he is dead since"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"yesterday, and set up a tomb over him.--And Shahrazad perceived"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the dawn of day and ceased to say her per misted say.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"              When it was the Thirty-fourth Night,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"China bade, Bring me the Barber who shall be the cause of your"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"deliverance; then we will bury this Hunchback, for that he is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,dead since yesterday and set up a tomb over him. So the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Chamberlain and the Tailor went to the jail and, releasing the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Barber, presently returned with him to the King. The Sultan of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,China looked at him and considered him carefully and lo and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"behold! he was an ancient man, past his ninetieth year; swart of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"face, white of beard, and hoar of eyebrows; lop eared and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"proboscis-nosed,[FN#696] with a vacant, silly and conceited"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,expression of countenance. The King laughed at this figure o' fun
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and said to him, O Silent Man, I desire thee to tell me somewhat"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of thy history. Quoth the Barber, O King of the age, allow me"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,first to ask thee what is the tale of this Nazarene and this Jew
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,and this Moslem and this Hunchback (the corpse) I see among you?
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,And prithee what may be the object of this assemblage? Quoth the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King of China, And why dost thou ask? I ask, he replied, in"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,order that the King's majesty may know that I am no forward
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,fellow or busy body or impertinent meddler; and that I am
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,innocent of their calumnious charges of overmuch talk; for I am
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"he whose name is the Silent Man, and indeed peculiarly happy is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"my sobriquet, as saith the poet:"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"When a nickname or little name men design, * Know that nature"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     with name shall full oft combine.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Then said the King, Explain to the Barber the case of this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hunchback and what befell him at supper time; also repeat to him
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the stories told by the Nazarene, the Jew, the Reeve, and the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Tailor; and of no avail to me is a twice told tale. They did his
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"bidding, and the Barber shook his head and said, By Allah, this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,is a marvel of marvels! Now uncover me the corpse of yonder
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hunchback. They undid the winding sheet and he sat down and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"taking the Hunchback's head in his lap, looked at his face and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"laughed and guffaw'd[FN#697] till he fell upon his back and said,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"There is wonder in every death,[FN#698] but the death of this"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Hunchback is worthy to be written and recorded in letters of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,liquid gold! The bystanders were astounded at his words and the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"King marvelled and said to him, What ails thee, O Silent Man?"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Explain to us thy words ! O King of the age, said the Barber,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,I swear by thy beneficence that there is still life in this
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Gobbo Golightly! Thereupon he pulled out of his waist belt a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"barber's budget, whence he took a pot of ointment and anointed"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,therewith the neck of the Hunchback and its arteries. Then he
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"took a pair of iron tweezers and, inserting them into the"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Hunchback's throat, drew out the fid of fish with its bone; and,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"when it came to sight, behold, it was soaked in blood. Thereupon"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Hunchback sneezed a hearty sneeze and jumped up as if nothing
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"had happened and passing his hand over his face said, I testify"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"that there is no god, but the God, and I testify that Mohammed is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the Apostle of God. At this sight all present wondered; the King

THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"displeasure, doubt how to act and so forth. Pronounce, Lá haula"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,wa lá kuwwata illá bi 'lláhi 'I-Aliyyi 'I-Azim. As a rule
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,mistakes are marvellous: Mandeville (chaps. xii.) for Lá iláha
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"illa 'lláhu wa Muhammadun Rasúlu 'llah writes La ellec sila,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Machomete rores alla. The former (lá haula, etc.), on account of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the four peculiar Arabic letters, is everywhere pronounced"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,differently. and the exclamation is called Haulak or Haukal.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#117] An Arab holds that he has a right to marry his first
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"cousin, the daughter of his father's brother, and if any win her"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,from him a death and a blood-feud may result. It was the same in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,a modified form amongst the Jews and in both races the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,consanguineous marriage was not attended by the evil results
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"(idiotcy, congenital deafness, etc.) observed in mixed races like"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the English and the Anglo-American. When a Badawi speaks of the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,daughter of my uncle he means wife; and the former is the dearer
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"title, as a wife can be divorced, but blood is thicker than"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,water.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#118] Arab. Kahbah; the coarsest possible term. Hence the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"unhappy Cave of Don Roderick the Goth, which simply means The"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Whore.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#119] The Arab Banj and Hindú Bhang (which I use as most
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,familiar) both derive from the old Coptic Nibanj meaning a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,preparation of hemp (Cannabis sativa seu Indica); and here it is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,easy to recognise the Homeric Nepenthe. Al- Kazwini explains
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the term by garden hemp (Kinnab bostáni or Sháhdánaj). On the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,other hand not a few apply the word to the henbane (hyoscyamus
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,niger) so much used in mediæval Europe. The Kámús evidently means
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,henbane distinguishing it from Hashish al haráfísh = rascals'
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"grass, i.e. the herb Pantagruelion. The Alfáz Adwiya (French"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,translation) explains Tabannuj by Endormir quelqu'un en lui
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,faisant avaler de la jusquiame. In modern parlance Tabannuj is =
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"our anæsthetic administered before an operation, a deadener of"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pain like myrrh and a number of other drugs. For this purpose
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hemp is always used (at least I never heard of henbane); and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,various preparations of the drug are sold at an especial bazar in
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Cairo. See the powder of marvellous virtue in Boccaccio, iii.,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"8; and iv., 10. Of these intoxicants, properly so termed, I shall"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have something to say in a future page.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"The use of Bhang doubtless dates from the dawn of civilisation,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,whose earliest social pleasures would be inebriants. Herodotus
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,(iv. c. 75) shows the Scythians burning the seeds (leaves and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"capsules) in worship and becoming drunken with the fumes, as do"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the S. African Bushmen of the present day. This would be the
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,earliest form of smoking: it is still doubtful whether the pipe
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,was used or not. Galen also mentions intoxication by hemp.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Amongst Moslems, the Persians adopted the drink as an ecstatic,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"and about our thirteenth century Egypt, which began the practice,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,introduced a number of preparations to be noticed in the course
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,of The Nights.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"[FN#120] The rubbish heaps which outlie Eastern cities, some"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,(near Cairo) are over a hundred feet high.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#121] Arab. Kurrat al-aye; coolness of eyes as opposed to a
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,hot eye (sakhin) one red with tears. The term is true and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,picturesque so I translate it literally. All coolness is pleasant
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,to dwellers in burning lands: thus in Al-Hariri Abu Z yd says of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Bassorah, I found there whatever could fill the eye with"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,coolness. And a cool booty (or prize) is one which has been
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"secured without plunging into the flames of war, or imply a"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,pleasant prize.
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#122] Popularly rendered Caucasus (see Night cdxcvi): it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,corresponds so far with the Hindu Udaya that the sun rises
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,behind it; and the false dawn is caused by a hole or gap. It is
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"also the Persian Alborz, the Indian Meru (Sumeru), the Greek"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Olympus and the Rhiphæan Range (Veliki Camenypoys) or great
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"starry girdle of the world, etc."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#123] Arab. Mizr or Mizar; vulg. Búzah; hence the medical
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Lat. Buza, the Russian Buza (millet beer), our booze, the O."
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Dutch buyzen and the German busen. This is the old
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"of negro and negroid Africa, the beer of Osiris, of which dried"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,remains have been found in jars amongst Egyptian tombs. In
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Equatorial Africa it known as Pombe; on the Upper Nile Merissa
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"or Mirisi and amongst the Kafirs (Caffers) Tshuala, Oala or"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Boyala: I have also heard of Buswain Central Africa which may
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"be the origin of Buzah. In the West it became      , (Romaic"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"     ), Xythum and cerevisia or cervisia, the humor ex hordeo,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,long before the days of King Gambrinus. Central Africans drink it
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"in immense quantities: in Unyamwezi the standing bedsteads,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"covered with bark-slabs, are all made sloping so as to drain off"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,the liquor. A chief lives wholly on beef and Pombe which is thick
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"as gruel below. Hops are unknown: the grain, mostly Holcus, is"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"made to germinate, then pounded, boiled and left to ferment. In"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Egypt the drink is affected chiefly by Berbers, Nubians and"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"slaves from the Upper Nile, but it is a superior article and more"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,like that of Europe than the Pombe. I have given an account of
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"the manufacture in The Lake Regions of Central Africa, vol. ii.,"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"p. 286. There are other preparations, Umm-bulbul (mother nightie"

THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#127] The dying Badawi to his tribe (and lover) appears to

THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,"Reisebericht ueber Hauran, etc.):--"
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,     O bear with you my bones where the camel bears his load

THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,[FN#128] The Akásirah (plur. of Kasrá=Chosroës) is here a title

THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Káyánián (Medes and Persians) who ended with the Alexandrian

THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,have already been mentioned. But strictly speaking Kisri and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,Kasra are titles applied only to the latter dynasty and
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT ,Fantasy,especially to the great King Anushirwan. They must not be

Analects by Confucius,Lecture,The Master Is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application?
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters?
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The philosopher Yu said, They are few who, being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The superior man bends his attention to what is radical. That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. Filial piety and fraternal submission,-are they not the root of all benevolent actions?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The philosopher Tsang said, I daily examine myself on three points:-whether, in transacting business for others, I may have been not faithful;-whether, in intercourse with friends, I may have been not sincere;-whether I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, A youth, when at home, should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should employ them in polite studies."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-hsia said, If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, If the scholar be not grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning will not be solid."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them. The philosopher Tsang said, Let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice;-then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung saying, When our master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to him?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-kung said, Our master is benign, upright, courteous, temperate, and complaisant and thus he gets his information. The master's mode of asking information,-is it not different from that of other men?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The philosopher Yu said, In practicing the rules of propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed by the ancientkings, this is the excellent quality, and in things small and great we follow them."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be done."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The philosopher Yu said, When agreements are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he can make them his guides and masters."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, He who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite, nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified:-such a person may be said indeed to love to learn."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-kung said, What do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich man who is not proud? The Master replied, They will do; but they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-kung replied, It is said in the Book of Poetry, 'As you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish.'-The meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just expressed."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to talk about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper sequence."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, I will not be afflicted at men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know men."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Part 2
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, In the Book of Poetry are three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be embraced in one sentence 'Having no depraved thoughts.'"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"At thirty, I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven. At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Mang I asked what filial piety was. The Master said, It is not being disobedient."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,-'not being disobedient.'"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Fan Ch'ih said, What did you mean? The Master replied, That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Mang Wu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, Parents are anxious lest their children should be sick."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The Master said, The filial piety nowadays means the support of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do something in the way of support;-without reverence, what is there to distinguish the one support given from the other?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The Master said, The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial piety?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I said;-as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-He is not stupid."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, See what a man does. Mark his motives. Examine in what things he rests. How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The accomplished scholar is not a utensil."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-kung asked what constituted the superior man. The Master said, He acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The superior man is catholic and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The study of strange doctrines is injurious indeed!"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Yu, shall I teach you what knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it;-this is knowledge."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Tsze-chang was learning with a view to official emolument.
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Hear much and put aside the points of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the same time of the others:-then you will afford few occasions for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying the others into practice: then you will have few occasions for repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in the way to get emolument."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Duke Ai asked, saying, What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people? Confucius replied, Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, Let him preside over them with gravity;-then they will reverence him. Let him be final and kind to all;-then they will be faithful to him. Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Some one addressed Confucius, saying, Sir, why are you not engaged in the government?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, What does the Shu-ching say of filial piety?-'You are final, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This then also constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be THAT-making one be in the government?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, I do not know how a man without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be made to go without the crossbar for yoking the oxen to, or a small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after could be known.
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Confucius said, The Yin dynasty followed the regulations of the Hsia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. The Chau dynasty has followed the regulations of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,To see what is right and not to do it is want of courage.
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Part 3
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Confucius said of the head of the Chi family, who had eight rows of pantomimes in his area, If he can bear to do this, what may he not bear to do?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The three families used the Yungode, while the vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice. The Master said, 'Assisting are the princes;-the son of heaven looks profound and grave';-what application can these words have in the hall of the three families?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with music?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be attended to in ceremonies.
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, A great question indeed! In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than extravagant. In the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow than in minute attention to observances."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The rude tribes of the east and north have their princes, and are not like the States of our great land which are without them."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The chief of the Chi family was about to sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, Can you not save him from this? He answered, I cannot. Confucius said, Alas! will you say that the T'ai mountain is not so discerning as Lin Fang?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The student of virtue has no contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-hsia asked, saying, What is the meaning of the passage-'The pretty dimples of her artful smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain ground for the colors?'"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The business of laying on the colors follows the preparation of the plain ground."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing? The Master said, It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can begin to talk about the odes with him."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, I could describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. They cannot do so because of the insufficiency of their records and wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in support of my words."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, At the great sacrifice, after the pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Some one asked the meaning of the great sacrifice. The Master said, I do not know. He who knew its meaning would find it as easy to govern the kingdom as to look on this-pointing to his palm."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"He sacrificed to the dead, as if they were present. He sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, I consider my not being present at the sacrifice, as if I did not sacrifice."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Wang-sun Chia asked, saying, What is the meaning of the saying, 'It is better to pay court to the furnace then to the southwest corner?'"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Not so. He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Chau had the advantage of viewing the two past dynasties. How complete and elegant are its regulations! I follow Chau."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master, when he entered the grand temple, asked about everything. Some one said, Who say that the son of the man of Tsau knows the rules of propriety! He has entered the grand temple and asks about everything. The Master heard the remark, and said, This is a rule of propriety."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, In archery it is not going through the leather which is the principal thing;-because people's strength is not equal. This was the old way."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The full observance of the rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by people to be flattery."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Duke Ting asked how a prince should employ his ministers, and how ministers should serve their prince. Confucius replied, A prince should employ his minister according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The Kwan Tsu is expressive of enjoyment without being licentious, and of grief without being hurtfully excessive."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the altars of the spirits of the land. Tsai Wo replied, The Hsia sovereign planted the pine tree about them; the men of the Yin planted the cypress; and the men of the Chau planted the chestnut tree, meaning thereby to cause the people to be in awe."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"When the Master heard it, he said, Things that are done, it is needless to speak about; things that have had their course, it is needless to remonstrate about; things that are past, it is needless to blame."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Small indeed was the capacity of Kwan Chung!"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Some one said, Was Kwan Chung parsimonious? Kwan, was the reply, had the San Kwei, and his officers performed no double duties; how can he be considered parsimonious?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Then, did Kwan Chung know the rules of propriety? The Master said, The princes of States have a screen intercepting the view at their gates. Kwan had likewise a screen at his gate. The princes of States on any friendly meeting between two of them, had a stand on which to place their inverted cups. Kwan had also such a stand. If Kwan knew the rules of propriety, who does not know them?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master instructing the grand music master of Lu said, How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The border warden at Yi requested to be introduced to the Master, saying, When men of superior virtue have come to this, I have never been denied the privilege of seeing them. The followers of the sage introduced him, and when he came out from the interview, he said, My friends, why are you distressed by your master's loss of office? The kingdom has long been without the principles of truth and right; Heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its wooden tongue."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,The Master said of the Shao that it was perfectly beautiful and also perfectly good. He said of the Wu that it was perfectly beautiful but not perfectly good.
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, High station filled without indulgent generosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted without sorrow;-wherewith should I contemplate such ways?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Part 4
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, It is virtuous manners which constitute the excellence of a neighborhood. If a man in selecting a residence do not fix on one where such prevail, how can he be wise?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, It is only the truly virtuous man, who can love, or who can hate, others."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, If the will be set on virtue, there will be no practice of wickedness."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Riches and honors are what men desire. If they cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If they cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfill the requirements of that name?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, I have not seen a person who loved virtue, or one who hated what was not virtuous. He who loved virtue, would esteem nothing above it. He who hated what is not virtuous, would practice virtue in such a way that he would not allow anything that is not virtuous to approach his person."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Is any one able for one day to apply his strength to virtue? I have not seen the case in which his strength would be insufficient.
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Should there possibly be any such case, I have not seen it."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The faults of men are characteristic of the class to which they belong. By observing a man's faults, it may be known that he is virtuous."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, If a man in the morning hear the right way, he may die in the evening hear regret."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, A scholar, whose mind is set on truth, and who is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food, is not fit to be discoursed with."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The superior man, in the world, does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort. The superior man thinks of the sanctions of law; the small man thinks of favors which he may receive."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,The Master said: He who acts with a constant view to his own advantage will be much murmured against.
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, If a prince is able to govern his kingdom with the complaisance proper to the rules of propriety, what difficulty will he have? If he cannot govern it with that complaisance, what has he to do with the rules of propriety?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, A man should say, I am not concerned that I have no place, I am concerned how I may fit myself for one. I am not concerned that I am not known, I seek to be worthy to be known."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Shan, my doctrine is that of an all-pervading unity. The disciple Tsang replied, Yes."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master went out, and the other disciples asked, saying, What do his words mean? Tsang said, The doctrine of our master is to be true to the principles-of our nature and the benevolent exercise of them to others,-this and nothing more."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The mind of the superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean man is conversant with gain."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, When we see men of worth, we should think of equaling them; when we see men of a contrary character, we should turn inwards and examine ourselves."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, In serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently; when he sees that they do not incline to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, While his parents are alive, the son may not go abroad to a distance. If he does go abroad, he must have a fixed place to which he goes."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, If the son for three years does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The years of parents may by no means not be kept in the memory, as an occasion at once for joy and for fear."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, The cautious seldom err. The Master said, The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-yu said, In serving a prince, frequent remonstrances lead to disgrace. Between friends, frequent reproofs make the friendship distant."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,Part 5
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said of Kung-ye Ch'ang that he might be wived; although he was put in bonds, he had not been guilty of any crime. Accordingly, he gave him his own daughter to wife."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Of Nan Yung he said that if the country were well governed he would not be out of office, and if it were in governed, he would escape punishment and disgrace. He gave him the daughter of his own elder brother to wife."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said of Tsze-chien, Of superior virtue indeed is such a man! If there were not virtuous men in Lu, how could this man have acquired this character?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-kung asked, What do you say of me, Ts'ze! The Master said, You are a utensil. What utensil? A gemmed sacrificial utensil."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Some one said, Yung is truly virtuous, but he is not ready with his tongue."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, What is the good of being ready with the tongue? They who encounter men with smartness of speech for the most part procure themselves hatred. I know not whether he be truly virtuous, but why should he show readiness of the tongue?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master was wishing Ch'i-tiao K'ai to enter an official employment. He replied, I am not yet able to rest in the assurance of this. The Master was pleased."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, My doctrines make no way. I will get upon a raft, and float about on the sea. He that will accompany me will be Yu, I dare say. Tsze-lu hearing this was glad, upon which the Master said, Yu is fonder of daring than I am. He does not exercise his judgment upon matters."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Mang Wu asked about Tsze-lu, whether he was perfectly virtuous. The Master said, I do not know."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"He asked again, when the Master replied, In a kingdom of a thousand chariots, Yu might be employed to manage the military levies, but I do not know whether he be perfectly virtuous."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"And what do you say of Ch'iu? The Master replied, In a city of a thousand families, or a clan of a hundred chariots, Ch'iu might be employed as governor, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"What do you say of Ch'ih? The Master replied, With his sash girt and standing in a court, Ch'ih might be employed to converse with the visitors and guests, but I do not know whether he is perfectly virtuous."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said to Tsze-kung, Which do you consider superior, yourself or Hui?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-kung replied, How dare I compare myself with Hui? Hui hears one point and knows all about a subject; I hear one point, and know a second."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, You are not equal to him. I grant you, you are not equal to him."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsai Yu being asleep during the daytime, the Master said, Rotten wood cannot be carved; a wall of dirty earth will not receive the trowel. This Yu,-what is the use of my reproving him?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, At first, my way with men was to hear their words, and give them credit for their conduct. Now my way is to hear their words, and look at their conduct. It is from Yu that I have learned to make this change."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"The Master said, I have not seen a firm and unbending man. Some one replied, There is Shan Ch'ang. Ch'ang, said the Master, is under the influence of his passions; how can he be pronounced firm and unbending?"
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-kung said, What I do not wish men to do to me, I also wish not to do to men. The Master said, Ts'ze, you have not attained to that."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-kung said, The Master's personal displays of his principles and ordinary descriptions of them may be heard. His discourses about man's nature, and the way of Heaven, cannot be heard."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"When Tsze-lu heard anything, if he had not yet succeeded in carrying it into practice, he was only afraid lest he should hear something else."
Analects by Confucius,Lecture,"Tsze-kung asked, saying, On what ground did Kung-wan get that title of Wan?"
